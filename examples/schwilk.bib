                  including two presumed closely related
                  genera. Ceanothus and Noltea as outgroups. In
                  addition to a parsimony analysis of the equally
                  weighted characters, analyses investigating the:
                  effects of character weighting, removal of a
                  presumed hybrid species as well as the impact of
                  uncertainly scored characters were undertaken. In
                  ail analyses Noltea was placed as sister group to a
                  well supported monophyletic Colletieae. Nineteen
                  different ingroup topologies were found, with the
                  additional analyses mainly supporting two of
                  them. Within the Colletieae a basal dichotomy
                  divides Trevoa and Retanilla from the remainder of
                  the tribe. While the Trevoa-Retanilla clade is fully
                  resolved, the second lacks detailed
                  resolution. Within this clade the Colletia species
                  form a weil supported monophyletic group, while
                  monophyly of the disjunct genus Discaria could not

  abstract =     {Prior studies of a broad array of seed plants have
                  reported strong correlations among leaf life span,
                  specific leaf area, nitrogen concentration, and
                  carbon assimilation rates, which have been
                  interpreted as evidence of coordinated leaf
                  physiological strategies. However, it is not known
                  whether these relationships reflect patterns of
                  evolutionary convergence, or whether they are due to
                  contrasting characteristics of major seed plant
                  lineages. We reevaluated a published data set for
                  these seven traits measured in over 100 species,
                  using phylogenetic independent contrasts calculated
                  over a range of alternative seed plant phylogenies
                  derived from recent molecular systematic
                  analyses. In general, pairwise correlations among
                  these seven traits were similar with and without
                  consideration of phylogeny, and results were robust
                  over a range of alternative phylogenies. We also
                  evaluated relationships between these seven traits
                  and lamina area, another important aspect of leaf
                  function, and found moderate correlations with
                  specific leaf area (0.64), mass-based photosynthesis
                  (0.54), area-based nitrogen (-0.56), and leaf life
                  span (-0.42). However, several of these correlations
                  were markedly reduced using independent contrasts;
                  for example, the correlation between leaf life span
                  and lamina area was reduced to close to zero. This
                  change reflects the large differences in both these
                  traits between conifers and angiosperms and the
                  absence of a relationship between the traits within
                  these groups. This analysis illustrates that most
                  interspecific relationships among leaf functional
                  traits, considered across a broad range of seed
                  plant taxa, reflect significant patterns of
                  correlated evolutionary change, lending further
                  support to the adaptive interpretation of these
                  relationships.},

                  phylogenetic information into studies of continuous
                  traits, particularly analyses of evolutionary trait
                  correlations, but the effects of taxon sampling on
                  these analyses have received little attention. In
                  this paper, simulations were used to investigate the
                  effects of taxon sampling patterns and alternative
                  branch length assignments on the statistical
                  performance of correlation coefficients and sign
                  tests; ''full-tree'' analyses based on contrasts at
                  all nodes and ''paired-comparisons'' based only on
                  contrasts of terminal taxon pairs were also
                  compared. The simulations showed that random
                  samples, with respect to the traits under
                  consideration, provide statistically robust
                  estimates of trait correlations. However, exact
                  significance tests are highly dependent on
                  appropriate branch length information; equal branch
                  lengths maintain lower Type I error than alternative
                  topological approaches, and adjusted critical values
                  of the independent contrast correlation coefficient
                  are provided for use with equal branch
                  lengths. Nonrandom samples, with respect to
                  univariate or bivariate trait distributions,
                  introduce discrepancies between interspecific and
                  phylogenetically structured analyses and bias
                  estimates of underlying evolutionary
                  correlations. Examples of nonrandom sampling
                  processes may include community assembly processes,
                  convergent evolution under local adaptive pressures,
                  selection of a nonrandom sample of species from a
                  habitat or life-history group, or investigator
                  bias. Correlation analyses based on species pairs
                  comparisons, while ignoring deeper relationships,
                  entail significant loss of statistical power and as
                  a result provide a conservative test of trait
                  associations. Paired comparisons in which species
                  differ by a large amount in one trait, a method
                  introduced in comparative plant ecology, have
                  appropriate Type I error rates and high statistical
                  power, but do not correctly estimate the magnitude
                  of trait correlations. Sign tests, based on
                  full-tree or paired-comparison approaches, are
                  highly reliable across a wide range of sampling
                  scenarios, in terms of Type I error rates, but have
                  very low power. These results provide guidance for
                  selecting species and applying comparative methods
                  to optimize the performance of statistical tests of
                  trait associations.},

  abstract =     {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic
                  variation and environmental conditions, the "fit" of
                  organisms to their environment, reflects the
                  adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several
                  processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity,
                  ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This
                  article addresses the importance of ecological
                  sorting processes (community assembly, migration,
                  habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of
                  functional trait distributions at the local and
                  landscape level. In relatively saturated
                  communities, plants will establish and regenerate in
                  environments to which they are well adapted, so
                  their distributions, and the distributions of
                  associated functional traits, will reflect the
                  distribution of optimal or near-optimal
                  environmental conditions in space and time. The
                  predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is
                  that traits related to habitat occupancy, e. g.,
                  environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing
                  selection. This process contributes to the widely
                  observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism,
                  i. e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of
                  closely related species. Evidence for niche
                  conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson
                  and Overpeck's concept of the realized environment,
                  I propose three scenarios in which a species'
                  distributional responses to environmental conditions
                  will lead to a "mismatch" between its environmental
                  tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus
                  creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1)
                  the colonization of "environmental islands"
                  (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space)
                  that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of
                  one or more environmental factors; (2) the
                  persistence of "trailing-edge" populations in
                  species tracking changing climate, if barriers to
                  dispersal of competitors prevent competitive
                  exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3)
                  responses to changes in the realized environment in
                  multidimensional niche space, in which species are
                  predicted to track environmental factors for which
                  they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive
                  evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit
                  greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide
                  a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of
                  ecological sorting processes and stabilizing
                  selection as the context for understanding
                  opportunities for adaptive evolution in
                  heterogeneous and changing environments.},

                  Mt. Fuji-type fitness landscape in a multivalued
                  sequence space (Aita and Husimi, 1996,
                  J. theor. Biol. 182, 469-485), we investigated the
                  properties of adaptive walks on the ideal landscape
                  in the case of a cloning-screening-type evolution
                  experiment. We modeled that an adaptive walk is
                  performed by repetition of the evolution cycle
                  composed of the mutagenesis process generating
                  random d-fold point mutants of population size N and
                  the selection process looking for the fittest mutant
                  among them. While an adaptive walk is described in a
                  sequence space, we simplified the description as
                  follows. We mapped the landscape in an x-y plane,
                  where x and y represent a normalized Hamming
                  distance from the global peak and a scaled fitness,
                  respectively. An adaptive walk is described as a
                  trajectory in the plane. The most certain step for a
                  walker to move in a single evolution cycle is
                  represented by a vector in the plane. Then. a walker
                  moves along the streams in the vector field
                  determined by d and N. The walker performs fast
                  hill-climbing until a ''trap-line'', which traverses
                  the plane. Subsequently, the walker is likely to gel
                  trapped in an ''apparent local optimum''. To
                  continue the walk, apparent local optima must be
                  eliminated by resetting d smaller or N
                  larger. Therefore, for the fastest walk, the optimal
                  schedule of the d-values (initially large d, then
                  small ri) is effective, although the economical walk
                  with high cost-performance is different. If a real
                  landscape is just of the hit. Fuji-type, the walk
                  with the highest cost-performance will be performed
                  by scanning site-directed optimization through all
                  sites. However, in the case of the rough
                  Mt. Fuji-type, which seems to be more realistic, the
                  walking method we have examined will be effective
                  for a walker to sidestep true local optima. (C) 1998

                  uncorrelated random component on an additive fitness
                  landscape. A single adaptive walk is carried out by
                  repetition of the evolution cycle composed of (1)
                  mutagenesis process that produces random d-fold
                  point mutants of population size N and (2) selection
                  process that picks out the fittest mutant among
                  them. To comprehend trajectories of the walkers, the
                  fitness landscape is mapped into a (x, y, z)-space,
                  where x, y and z represent, respectively, normalized
                  Hamming distance from the peak on the additive
                  fitness landscape, scaled additive fitness and
                  scaled non-additive fitness. Thus a single adaptive
                  walk is expressed as the dynamics of a particle in
                  this space. We drew the ''hill-climbing'' vector
                  field, where each vector represents the most
                  probable step for a walker in a single step. Almost
                  all of the walkers are expected to move along
                  streams of vectors existing on a particular surface

                  generally 1-10 times greater in soil under Lupinus
                  than under Artemisia or between shrubs. Soil water
                  content was mostly lower under shrubs. Mean photon

                  least 80% at greater than or equal to 35 cm inside

                  between competition and dispersal should lead to
                  regional coexistence of competing species. Empirical
                  investigations, however, find local coexistence of
                  superior and inferior competitors, an outcome that
                  cannot be explained within the patch occupancy
                  framework because of the decoupling of local and
                  spatial dynamics. We develop two-patch
                  metapopulation models that explicitly consider the
                  interaction between competition and dispersal. We
                  show that a dispersal-competition trade-off can lead
                  to local coexistence provided the inferior
                  competitor is superior at colonizing empty patches
                  as well as immigrating among occupied
                  patches. Immigration from patches that the superior
                  competitor cannot colonize rescues the inferior
                  competitor from extinction in patches that both
                  species colonize. Too much immigration, however, can
                  be detrimental to coexistence. When competitive
                  asymmetry between species is high, local coexistence
                  is possible only if the dispersal rate of the
                  inferior competitor occurs below a critical
                  threshold. If competing species have comparable
                  colonization abilities and the environment is
                  otherwise spatially homogeneous, a superior ability
                  to immigrate among occupied patches cannot prevent
                  exclusion of the inferior competitor. If, however,
                  biotic or abiotic factors create spatial
                  heterogeneity in competitive rankings across the
                  landscape, local coexistence can occur even in the
                  absence of a dispersal-competition trade-off. In
                  fact, coexistence requires that the dispersal rate
                  of the overall inferior competitor not exceed a
                  critical threshold. Explicit consideration of how
                  dispersal modifies local competitive interactions
                  shifts the focus from the patch occupancy approach
                  with its emphasis on extinction-colonization
                  dynamics to the realm of source-sink dynamics. The
                  key to coexistence in this framework is spatial
                  variance in fitness. Unlike in the patch occupancy
                  framework, high rates of dispersal can undermine
                  coexistence, and hence diversity, by reducing
                  spatial variance in fitness.},

                  epidemiological categorization of individuals
                  (infected, susceptible, latent and resistant) and
                  the patch structure of a spatially heterogeneous
                  landscape (occupied-suitable, empty-suitable,
                  occupied-unsuitable and empty-unsuitable). This
                  approach allows one to consider life-history
                  attributes that influence persistence in patchy
                  environments (e.g., longevity, colonization ability)
                  in concert with extrinsic processes (e.g.,
                  disturbances, succession) that lead to spatial
                  heterogeneity in patch suitability. It also allows
                  the incorporation of seed banks and other dormant
                  life forms, thus broadening patch occupancy dynamics
                  to include sink habitats. We use the model to
                  investigate how equilibrium patch occupancy is
                  influenced by four critical parameters: colonization
                  rate? extinction rate, disturbance frequency and the
                  rate of habitat succession. This analysis leads to
                  general predictions about how the temporal scaling
                  of patch succession and extinction-colonization
                  dynamics influences long-term persistence. We apply
                  the model to herbaceous, early-successional species
                  that inhabit open patches created by periodic
                  disturbances. We predict the minimum disturbance

                  element in narrowing this gap. This review attempts
                  to synthesize spatial competition theory into such a
                  framework, with the goal of motivating empirical
                  investigations that adopt the comparative
                  approach. The synthesis presented is based on a
                  major axis, coexistence in spatially homogeneous
                  vs. heterogeneous competitive environments, along
                  which the theory can be organized. The resulting
                  framework integrates such key concepts as niche
                  theory, spatial heterogeneity and spatial scale(s)
                  of coexistence. It yields comparative predictions
                  that can guide empirical investigations.},

                  after defoliation may result from shifts in leaf
                  photosynthetic characteristics or from an improved
                  light penetration in the canopy. However, few
                  studies have tried to estimate the relative
                  contribution of these factors to mitigating the
                  negative effects of defoliation. We present a
                  quantitative framework for such an analysis. 2, In a
                  field and greenhouse experiment, plants of the rain
                  forest understorey palm Chamaedorea elegans were
                  subjected to three levels of defoliation (0, 50 or
                  66\% of leaves removed) and, in the greenhouse,
                  grown at two irradiances (5 or 16\% of daylight,
                  'low light' and 'high light' hereafter). For each
                  plant, leaf photosynthesis and light penetration in
                  the canopy were measured and these data were used to
                  calculate whole-canopy carbon gain. 3, Defoliation
                  significantly increased the light available to the
                  remaining leaves. In the field and in the
                  'high-light' greenhouse plants, defoliation also
                  resulted in an increase in the light-saturated
                  photosynthesis per unit leaf area (P-max), although
                  in the 'Iow-light' plants this was not the case. 4,
                  A sensitivity analysis revealed that in the
                  'Iow-light' plants, a proportional increase in leaf
                  P-max did not result in increased canopy-level
                  carbon gain, while in the 'high-light' and field
                  plants, it did. This suggests that the lack of
                  plasticity in P-max in response to defoliation, at
                  low light, may be the appropriate pattern to
                  maximize carbon gain. 5, Defoliated plants had
                  10-18\% more average photosynthesis per unit leaf
                  area (P-area) than the control plants, and this
                  increase was mostly the result of an improved light
                  penetration in the canopy. 6. A relatively small
                  fraction (5-30\%) of the total estimated loss in
                  canopy carbon gain caused by the removal of leaves
                  was compensated for by an increase in P-area. This
                  suggests that in rain forest understorey plants, an
                  increase in diurnal photosynthesis of remaining
                  leaves has limited potential for mitigating the
                  negative effects of defoliation.},

                  plants of the tropical understory palm Chamaedorea
                  elegans are able to mitigate the negative effects of
                  defoliation on performance (i.e., plant size, total
                  growth, leaf lamina growth, and reproduction) and
                  how this is related to light availability. For this
                  purpose we developed a new approach that allowed us
                  to quantify the performance of defoliated plants
                  relative not only to the performance of undamaged
                  plants, but also relative to the estimated
                  performance of hypothetical defoliated plants that
                  do not exhibit any. mechanisms of compensatory
                  growth. The latter provides a way to quantify the
                  adaptive value of compensation with reference to a
                  hypothetical noncompensating alternative
                  state. C. elegans plants were grown in a greenhouse
                  at two light levels (5% and 16% of natural daylight)
                  and subjected to five defoliation treatments (a
                  control and four levels of defoliation). Defoliation
                  was repeated every three months. Growth analysis
                  revealed that defoliated plants allocated
                  considerably more mass to the production of leaf
                  laminas (f(lam)) than control plants, at the expense
                  of allocation to other organs, particularly
                  reproductive structures. Average growth rates per
                  unit leaf area (NAR) and per unit plant mass (RGR),
                  both measured on the basis of above-ground mass,
                  increased with the level of defoliation at high
                  light but not at low light. We estimated that the
                  increases in f(lam) and NAR enabled C. elegans to
                  compensate for part of the potential loss in
                  performance caused by defoliation, even in cases
                  where their RGR values were lower than those of
                  control plants. Sensitivity analysis indicated that
                  changes in NAR contributed more to this compensation
                  than f(lam), but the importance of f(lam) increased
                  with defoliation level and with decreasing light
                  availability. The degree of compensation was higher
                  in the high- than in the low-light treatment,
                  suggesting that the possession of traits associated
                  with compensatory growth. may be more important in
                  sunny than in shaded environments. The degree of
                  compensation differed depending on the measure of
                  performance. Defoliated plants fully compensated for
                  the potential reduction in lamina growth but
                  compensated for <20% of estimated loss in
                  reproductive output. Since survival of C. elegans
                  plants appears to be. strongly associated with their
                  total leaf area, the greater compensation for lamina
                  growth is important in relation to population
                  dynamics.},

                  dispersal and seed predation on the soil seedbank in
                  six shrubby species of Grevillea from the Sydney
                  region of southeastern Australia was examined in
                  selective exclusion experiments, seed array trials
                  and placement of single seeds on the ground. Two
                  distinct seed types in Grevillea were examined and
                  different seed dispersal and post-dispersal seed
                  predation patterns were associated with each: (a)
                  seeds lacking an elaiosome were not attractive to
                  ants and annual seed losses of between 82 and 95%
                  were found in vegetation unburnt for greater than 8
                  years. Native rodents, Rattus fuscipes, and
                  macropods, Wallabia bicolor, were responsible for
                  these seed losses; (b) seeds with an elaiosome were
                  rapidly handled by ants. Two functional types of
                  ants were recognised. Most encounters were by ants
                  that were small (Local) relative to seed size and
                  these ants simply removed the elaiosome in situ or
                  moved seeds only small distances (< 20 cm). Some
                  0-24% of ant/seed encounters were by large
                  (Removalist) ant species that were capable of moving
                  seeds back to nests. In addition, Rattus fuscipes
                  and Wallabia bicolor consumed at least 32-68% of
                  seeds of Grevillea species with an elaiosome. Ants
                  may reduce the overall levels of seed predation
                  where seeds moved by Removalist ant species escape
                  predation and are deposited in safe sites, hence
                  allowing more seeds to reach the persistent soil
                  seedbank. Mammals do not consume all seeds when ants
                  are excluded, allowing for the potential for some
                  seed escape from predation after seeds are discarded
                  by Local ant species.},

                  responsible for seed losses after seeds fell below
                  parent plants. Virtually all seeds (99-100%) were
                  lost to these mammals for the first two fruiting
                  seasons after a wildfire. Such losses usually
                  exceeded pre-fire loss estimates or estimates from a
                  site unburnt for more than 10 years. There was no
                  significant difference in seed losses to mammals in
                  three recently burnt sites over four fruiting
                  seasons. However, there was a slight trend for some
                  seed escape (seed losses 91-97%) acid a slowing of
                  the rate of seed loss in the fourth fruiting season
                  after fire. Time since the last fire accounted for
                  some 60% of the estimated variation in magnitude of
                  seed losses to mammals. These results suggest that

                  be protected from the risk of a future fire well
                  beyond three times the primary juvenile period in
                  the species or local extinction will occur. (C) 2001

                  maximum near the top of the canopy. For 5-yr old
                  plants a structural transition started with leaf
                  profiles showing a bimodal distribution. Leaf
                  biomass predominated near the base in 6-yr old
                  plants, suggesting that the transition was
                  completed. Three canopy stages in the growth
                  processes of the plant were recognized after the
                  first year of growth: in the first one (from 2 to 3
                  yr old) both leaf and supportive biomass increased;
                  in the second one (from 3 to 4 yr) leaf biomass
                  remained stable and there was an increase in
                  supportive biomass until the plants reached a
                  'mature stage', in 4-yr old plants; finally, in 5-
                  and 6-yr old plants there was a decrease both in
                  leaf and supportive biomass and plant structure
                  showed evidence of senescence. Early transitions
                  from seedling to l-yr old plant and from this to 2-
                  to 3-yr old plants were less obvious. The
                  leaf/supportive biomass ratio always decreased with
                  plant age, from 1.88 in seedlings to 0.01 in 6-yr
                  old plants. Biomass density followed the pattern of
                  supportive biomass, with an increase from 1.7
                  g/dm(3) (2-yr old plants) to 2.4 g/dm(3) (4-yr old
                  plants). Thereafter, biomass density decreased to
                  0.6 g/dm3 (6-yr old plants).},

  abstract =     {A general representation of multilocus selection is
                  extended to allow recombination to depend on
                  genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles
                  have small effects on recombination. The evolution
                  of such modifiers only depends on how they alter
                  recombination between the selected loci, and does
                  not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net
                  selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if
                  epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This
                  analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in
                  two ways: because it impedes the response to
                  epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it
                  facilitates the response to directional
                  selection. The first mechanism is implausible,
                  because epistasis must change sign over periods of a
                  few generations: faster or slower fluctuations
                  favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism
                  requires weak negative epistasis between favourable
                  alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in
                  check by mutation. The selection (s(i)) on
                  recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in
                  additive variance of log(fitness) due to linkage
                  disequilibria (v(1), < 0), and on non-additive
                  variance in log(fitness) (V'(2), V'(3),.. for
                  epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci
                  and pairwise epistasis, s(i) = -(v(1) +
                  4V(2)/3)delta r, where delta r is the average
                  increase in recombination caused by the
                  modifier. The approximations are checked against
                  exact calculations for three loci, and against
                  Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection
                  balance (1990), and directional selection
                  (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation
                  between selection on recombination and observable
                  components of fitness variation, which is open to
                  experimental test.},

                  hammock sites were harvested for biomass analyses to
                  compare potential flammability between two
                  ecosystems in the south-eastern coastal plain of the
                  United States. Plant components were separated into
                  live and dead foliage, accumulated litter on and
                  under the plant, and small and large stems. Foliar
                  biomass was further analysed for moisture content,
                  volatile solid content, and energy
                  content. Statistical analyses revealed differences
                  among species and between ecosystems. Serenoa repens
                  plants present a wildfire hazard because they
                  contain greater biomass than other species
                  studied. Ilex glabra and Lyonia ferruginea are also
                  hazardous to wildland-urban interface (WUI)
                  structures because they have greater foliar energy
                  content than other species studied. Callicarpa
                  americana plants present the least wildfire hazard
                  to WUI structures. We conclude that differences in
                  flammability among species exist, but the causes of
                  flammability are different among species. In
                  addition, species in the same genus do not always
                  have the same flammability. Based on measured
                  characteristics, understory plants in pine flatwoods
                  have greater ignitability, sustainability and
                  combustibility than understory plants in hardwood
                  hammocks. However, the measurements for
                  consumability were similar between ecosystems.},

                  known about fire regimes and variation in fire
                  regimes may not be independent of environmental
                  gradients or vegetation patterns. In this study, we
                  analyze variation in fire regime parameters (i.e.,
                  return interval, season, size, severity, and
                  rotation period) with respect to forest composition,
                  elevation, and potential soil moisture in a 2042 ha
                  area of montane forest in the southern Cascades in
                  the Thousand Lakes Wilderness (TLW). Fire regime
                  parameters varied with forest composition,
                  elevation, and potential soil moisture. Median
                  composite and point fire return intervals were
                  shorter (4-9 yr, 14-24 yr) in low elevation and more
                  xeric white fir (Abies concolor)-sugar pine (Pinus
                  lambertiana) and white fir-Jeffrey pine

                  mesic high elevation lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)
                  and red fir (Abies magnifica)-mountain hemlock
                  (Tsuga mertensiana) forests. Values for
                  mid-elevation red fir-white fir forests were
                  intermediate. The pattern for fire rotation lengths
                  across gradients was the same as for fire return
                  intervals. The percentage of fires that occurred
                  during the growing season was inversely related to
                  elevation and potential soil moisture. Mean fire
                  sizes were larger in lodgepole pine forests (405 ha)
                  than in other forest groups (103-151 ha). In
                  contrast to other parameters, fire severity did not
                  vary across environmental and compositional
                  gradients and >50% of all forests burned at high
                  severity with most of the remainder burning at
                  moderate severity. Since 1905, fire regimes have
                  become similar at all gradient positions because of
                  a policy of suppressing fire and fire regime
                  modification will lead to shifts in landscape scale

                  of Erica from the Cape Floristic Region, South
                  Africa were found to be considerably less than in
                  resprouters. Shoot starch was highly variable but
                  mean values were similar in both seeder and
                  resprouter species of Erica. Three distinct patterns
                  of starch storage in roots were recognized. All
                  seeder species fell within definitions of Categories
                  1 (narrow major and minor parenchymatous rays, one
                  to two cells wide with no inter-ray storage) or 2
                  (thick major rays up to seven cells wide and thin
                  minor rays with small amounts of inter-ray storage)
                  whereas resprouter species were consistently within
                  Categories 2 or 3 (broad major and minor rays, up to
                  eight cells wide and conspicuous inter-ray starch
                  storage). Results are discussed in light of similar
                  studies of the related Epacridaceae. 'Mixed' species
                  (i.e. with seeder or resprouter individuals present,
                  often in distinct populations) were always
                  classified as belonging to Category 2. Studies of
                  populations of three 'mixed' species confirmed that
                  seeder forms had consistently lower amounts of root
                  starch than resprouters. Rays of xylem parenchyma
                  were the main sites for starch storage in roots of
                  both seeders and resprouters and greater proportions
                  of cross-sectional area of roots were consistently
                  devoted to such storage tissues in resprouter forms
                  of the three 'mixed' species. Analyses of a number
                  of seeder and resprouter Erica coccinea populations
                  showed that differences in amounts of realised and
                  potential root starch storage are best explained by
                  the effect of regeneration behaviour rather than by
                  among-population variability.},

                  storage. Seeders, 75 % of the species investigated,
                  possessed a single main stem and a small root system
                  with lateral roots which in most cases did not
                  spread beyond the shoot canopy. Resprouter species
                  were generally multi-stemmed with large
                  lignotuberous root stocks. Certain seeder and
                  resprouter species were intermediate in form and
                  showed small root systems and basally branched main
                  stems. Amounts of starch in roots of seeders
                  (1.9+/-0.5 mg starch g d. wt per root) were much
                  less than in resprouters (14.1+/-3.3) whereas
                  amounts in shoots were similar (1.9+/-0.5 and
                  16+/-0.6 mg starch g d. wt per shoot,
                  respectively). Starch storage in roots was mostly
                  confined to rays of xylem parenchyma and inter-ray
                  xylem parenchyma and the greater storage capacity of
                  resprouters was generally due to broader
                  rays. Growth zones in root xylem ranged from clear,
                  verifiable annual rings, as in many seeder species,
                  to indistinct growth zones, typical of many
                  resprouter species. Shoot:root dry weight ratios
                  were higher in seeders than resprouters. The study
                  suggests that speciation within the Epacridaceae

                  differentiation in terms of morphology, shoot:root

                  neutral communities of ecologically equivalent
                  species. Diversity is described by species number S
                  and the variance of frequency or log abundance
                  q(similar to). The frequency distribution of
                  abundance is very generally lognormal, skewed to the
                  left by immigration and resembling descriptions of
                  natural communities. Increased immigration and
                  community size always cause S to increase. Their
                  effect on q(similar to) is more complicated, but
                  given biologically reasonable assumptions, S and
                  q(similar to) will be positively correlated in most
                  circumstances. Larger samples contain more species;
                  the graph of log S on log individuals, equivalent to
                  a species-area curve, is generally convex upward but
                  becomes linear with a slope of about +0.25 when
                  immigration is low and births exceed deaths. When
                  individuals invade a new, vacant environment, both S
                  and q(similar to) increase through rime. Thus, a
                  positive correlation between S and q(similar to)
                  will usually be generated when sites of differing
                  size or age are surveyed. At equilibrium,
                  communities maintain roughly constant levels of S
                  and q(similar to) but change in composition through
                  time; composition may remain similar, however, for
                  many generations. Many prominent patterns observed
                  in natural communities can therefore be generated by
                  a strictly neutral model. This does not show that
                  community structure is determined exclusively by
                  demographic stochasticity, but rather demonstrates
                  the necessity for an appropriate null model when
                  functional hypotheses are being tested.},

                  include Adenanthos (56%), Hakea (52\%), Dryandra
                  (35\%), and Grevillea (31\%). Within Banksia, 49\%
                  are resprouters, and it appears that the reseeding
                  syndrome is the derived character in this genus. The
                  proportion of resprouters within southwestern
                  Western Australian plant communities ranges from 66%
                  to 80%. These percentages are generally higher than
                  in more and parts of Western Australia and in
                  comparable plant communities from other
                  Mediterranean-type climates of the world. The
                  relatively high proportion of resprouters within
                  plant families and within plant communities probably
                  indicates that the Western Australian vegetation
                  experiences a harsher fire stress regime than do
                  other Mediterranean-type climate areas. Western
                  Australian plant communities have their highest
                  diversity in the early years after fire, when the
                  vegetation contains a higher number of reseeding
                  species and individuals. Seed banks are dominated by
                  the seeds of reseeders. There are no basic
                  differences in mean seed mass, viability, or
                  germinability of seeds between resprouting species
                  and reseeding species, but reseeders tend to have
                  narrower optimum germination temperature
                  regimes. Establishment success is related more to
                  seed mass, seedling size, and leaf ecophysiology and
                  morphology than to fire-response strategy. Reseeder
                  seedlings tend to grow faster than do resprouter
                  seedlings. Basic shrub morphology differs, with
                  reseeders generally being umbrella shaped and
                  resprouters urn shaped. Reseeding species most
                  commonly have a shallow, fibrous root
                  system. Resprouters have a massive, deeply
                  penetrating root system. Shoot:root ratios of
                  first-year seedlings and mature plants are higher
                  for reseeders. Resprouter seedlings store starch in
                  root tissue at a much greater rate than do reseeder
                  seedlings. Although the concentrations of essential
                  nutrients in seedlings are not different between
                  fire-response types, reseeders tend to conserve
                  nutrients to a greater extent through leaf
                  retention. Reseeders tend to produce greater numbers
                  of flowers and greater amounts of floral rewards,
                  but the breeding systems, which lead to the higher
                  seed set in reseeders, can vary between strict
                  outcrossing and considerable selfing. Reseeding
                  species are not likely to be wind
                  pollinated. Species survival in a fire-prone
                  environment can involve a wide range of combinations
                  of attributes. It appears that in Western Australian
                  reseeder species the lack of an ability to resprout
                  is compensated for by a number of other structural
                  and functional features. Knowledge of the
                  fire-response strategies of species of southwestern
                  Western Australia can influence fire-regime
                  management, conservation of rare species, and
                  restoration of vegetation after disturbance. Further
                  knowledge of the fire-response strategies of species
                  of the southwestern Western Australian flora should
                  result in better management of natural and restored
                  plant communities of the region.},

                  plants regain biomass lost during disturbance, but
                  there is a life history trade-off that occurs in all
                  disturbance regimes between investment in the
                  current generation through resprouting vs investment
                  in future generations at the same or more distant
                  sites. The relative allocation to resprouting vs
                  seeding in woody plant communities is dictated by
                  the nature of disturbance regimes. Resprouting is
                  the predominant response to the least severe
                  disturbance regimes, but is also a common response
                  in disturbance regimes of high severity, those that
                  destroy most or all above-ground biomass, and which
                  occur at medium to high frequency. The response to
                  disturbance either by resprouting or seeding is
                  dictated by the site's productivity. We present a
                  comprehensive model for relative allocation to
                  resprouting vs seeding across a range of disturbance
                  regimes. Competition between plants that mostly seed
                  vs those that mostly resprout should accentuate
                  differences in allocation along a gradient of
                  disturbance frequency. However the patchy nature of
                  disturbance in time and space, coupled with gene
                  flow among populations undergoing different
                  disturbance regimes, ensures that it is unlikely
                  that either resprouting or seeding will be the sole
                  response in most plant communities at most
                  disturbance frequencies. Additional influences on
                  resprouting in woody plant communities include
                  changes in allocation during the lifespan of
                  individual plants and phylogenetic constraints that
                  are expressed as biogeographic patterns.},

                  experiencing a serious water supply crisis as demand
                  increases from both rural areas and rapidly growing
                  towns and cities. New dams and water transfer
                  schemes are being constructed, but they are both
                  controversial and unlikely to fully satisfy
                  demand. Alien species of trees and plants have
                  invaded many parts of the country, taking over land
                  from indigenous species. These alien species consume
                  much more water than the indigenous vegetation, as
                  well as threatening biodiversity and constituting a
                  significant fire hazard. The Working for Water
                  Programme, established in 1995, and working in
                  partnership with local communities, aims to clear
                  invasive alien species and thus increase water
                  supply. The programme is examined in terms of its

                  root of seed weight. We tested the prediction by
                  planting seeds from 17 species ranging in weight
                  from 0.1 to 100 mg at a variety of depths in a sand
                  medium. The species were spread across 16 genera and
                  13 families, all occurring in fire-prone fynbos
                  shrublands of South Africa. Maximum emergence depth
                  was found to scale allometrically with seed weight
                  with an exponent of 0.334, close to the predicted
                  value. We used the allometry to predict recruitment
                  response to experimentally simulated variation in
                  fire intensity. Five species with small (<2 mg)
                  seeds and five with large (>10 mg) seeds were
                  planted at less than or equal to 20-mm and 40-mm
                  depths and exposed to low and high heat treatments
                  and a control. The allometric equation predicted
                  that species with large seeds would be able to
                  emerge from a depth of 40 mm but those with small
                  seeds would not. Only 1% of 481 seedlings from
                  small-seeded species emerged from the 40-mm planting
                  compared with 40% of 626 seedlings from the
                  large-seeded group. The simulated fire treatments
                  killed seeds in shallow, but not deeper, soil
                  layers. At simulated high fire intensities, seedling
                  emergence was poor in small-seeded species but good
                  in large-seeded species, with most seedlings
                  emerging from the 40-mm planting depth. Seed size
                  could be a useful general predictor of recruitment
                  success under different fire intensities in this
                  system. We suggest that allometric relationships in
                  plants deserve wider attention as predictive tools.}

  abstract =     {Changes in plant population size are usually
                  attributed to exogenous factors such as drought or
                  herbivore outbreaks. However, in theory, populations
                  may oscillate from endogenous density-dependent
                  causes alone. Under some conditions these
                  oscillations are very irregular and are called
                  chaos. There are very few examples of endogenous
                  oscillations in plants and these are
                  controversial. Large fluctuations in population size
                  occur after fires in many species of Proteaceae in
                  South African and Australian shrublands. These
                  non-sprouting species form single-aged cohorts with
                  recruitment dating from the last fire. Variation in
                  cohort size has usually been attributed to exogenous
                  factors, especially the length of the fire interval,
                  fire season, and post-bum weather conditions. We
                  studied the importance of endogenous
                  density-dependence in generating population
                  oscillations in these proteoid shrubs. Using a
                  variety of approaches, we show that
                  density-dependent reduction in fecundity may lead to
                  endogenous oscillations in some species. We explore
                  the "seeds of chaos" by defining attributes of
                  species and populations most likely to generate
                  endogenous oscillations. Finally, we note the
                  implications of the phenomenon for research in, and
                  management of, these systems.},

                  plants have not been as widely studied as in animals
                  and the importance of sexual selection in causing
                  dimorphism remains controversial. Sexual selection
                  is most obvious when it favours the evolution of a
                  trait which enhances mating success at the expense
                  of decreased viability. We studied the relationship
                  between floral display (number of inflorescences),
                  pollinator attraction and plant survival in a
                  dioecious shrub, Leucadendron
                  xanthoconus. Pollinator attraction, measured as the
                  number of insect pollinators, increased linearly
                  with floral display in males. However, males with
                  extravagant displays had a higher probability of
                  dying. Our data suggest that male plants are
                  undergoing selection on floral display for increased
                  mating success counterbalanced by selection against
                  plants with extravagant displays. Seed set in
                  females did not increase with floral display, except
                  at very low inflorescence numbers. Nor was female
                  survival correlated with floral display. Because
                  inflorescences are terminal in the species,
                  selection for more inflorescences in males causes
                  increased ramification, thinner terminal branches
                  and smaller leaves. Thus vegetative dimorphism in
                  this species appears to be caused by selection for
                  extravagant floral display in males, but not
                  females. Limits to dimorphism are imposed by
                  survival costs of elaborate display.},

  abstract =     {The role of fire in determining biome distribution
                  in South Afr ica has long been debated. Acocks
                  labelled veld types that he thought were 'fire
                  climax' as 'false'. He hypothesised that their
                  current extent was due to extensive forest clearance
                  by Iron Age farmers. We tested the relative
                  importance of fire and climate in determining
                  ecosystem characteristics by simulating potential
                  vegetation of South Africa with and without fire
                  using a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM). The
                  simulations suggest that most of the eastern half of
                  the country could support much higher stem biomass
                  without fire and that the vegetation would be
                  dominated by trees instead of grasses. Fynbos
                  regions in mesic winter rainfall areas would also
                  become tree dominated. We collated results of long
                  term fire exclusion studies to further test the
                  relative importance of fire and climate. These show
                  that grassy ecosystems with rainfall >650mm tend
                  towards fire-sensitive forests with fire
                  excluded. Areas below 650mm showed changes in tree
                  density and size but no trend of changing
                  composition to forest. We discuss recent evidence
                  that C-4 grasslands first appeared between 6 and 8M
                  years BP, long before the appearance of modern
                  humans. However these grassy ecosystems are among
                  the most recently developed biomes on the planet. We
                  briefly discuss the importance of fire in promoting
                  their spread in the late Tertiary.},

  abstract =     {The idea that flammability has evolved in many
                  fire-prone communities has been criticised for being
                  group-selectionist. However flammability may enhance
                  inclusive fitness if the resulting fires kill
                  neighbouring less flammable individuals and also
                  open recruitment possibilities. We modelled the
                  evolution of flammability using cellular automata to
                  simulate neighbourhood effects of burning. For
                  plants that survive fire only from unburnt canopies
                  (non-sprouters), increased flammability would cause
                  them to burn to death. Flammability traits can
                  evolve in such species only if they result in fire
                  spreading to kill less flammable neighbours and only
                  if they carry additional fitness benefits. In
                  species that resprout from roots or stem bases after
                  fire, flammability can evolve merely by increasing
                  neighbour mortality but is more likely to do so if
                  the associated traits had other benefits. Most
                  flammability-enhancing traits, both structural and
                  biochemical, are likely to have such additional
                  benefits. We predict that flammability traits will
                  be associated with dense populations where the
                  effect on neighbours is most marked and suggest
                  several tests. Fire has been a key, but neglected,
                  evolutionary force. Alteration of the fire regime
                  through the evolution of flammability, even in a
                  single species contributing heavily to fuel loads,
                  would result in the selective exclusion or admission
                  of other species to an ecosystem depending on the
                  compatibility of their pre-existing traits with

  abstract =     {Woody plants may be killed by severe disturbance or
                  resprout fr om vegetative tissue. Sprouters can
                  persist at a site through several generations of
                  nonsprouters. Differences in sprouting behavior are
                  therefore important for understanding vegetation
                  dynamics, extinction risks, and woody plant
                  management. Although sprouting appears not to be
                  uniquely correlated with many other intrinsic
                  attributes, such as specific leaf area or breeding
                  systems, a clear correlate is reduced seedling
                  aboveground growth rates from sprouters allocating
                  more to belowground structures. Consequently,
                  sprouters tend to have low seedling recruitment
                  rates, and saplings take longer to reach
                  maturity. Sprouters also tend to have lower seed
                  output than nonsprouters, but comparative studies
                  have seldom taken other trait differences such as
                  plant size into account. Added to these trade-offs
                  between persistence and recruitment, sprouters are
                  often multistemmed and shorter than related
                  nonsprouters and may be outcompeted by them when
                  disturbances are rare. Since sprouters tend to have
                  long generation times, damped demographic trends,
                  and gene flow across generations, it has been
                  suggested that their speciation rates would be
                  low. The available data, primarily from fire-prone
                  Gondwanan shrublands in South Africa, show no strong
                  differences in speciation rates of related sprouters
                  versus seeders. This indicates that ecological
                  factors are important determinants of the evolution
                  of fire life histories. Analysis of disturbance
                  regimes indicates a fundamental ecological
                  correlate: sprouters are favored where disturbance
                  regimes are frequent and severe in comparison to
                  regrowth rates. To bridge the gap between ecology
                  and evolution, data are needed on the genetical
                  differences between related species with contrasting
                  sprouter life histories.},

                  seedlings were excavated several months after a fire
                  in Cape fynbos. Seedlings under burnt parental
                  skeletons had short hypocotyls (mean 25 mm)
                  indicating passive dispersal whereas seedlings in
                  the open were more deeply buried (mean 48 mm) by
                  ants. Soil nutrient concentrations at the site of
                  germination were negatively related to depth of
                  burial and distance from parent. Ant dispersal
                  resulted in seedlings emerging in soils with lower
                  nutrient concentrations than passively dispersed
                  seeds. Tissue analysis supported the soil results
                  with lower P content in seedlings from open (ant
                  dispersed) sites. Seedling survival in the first
                  year of establishment was also lower in open sites,
                  but not significantly so. However seedlings were

                  accessible to a wider audience. Topics covered
                  include factors contributing to ecosystem
                  flammability and post-burn vegetation
                  survival. Demography, competition, community
                  organization, and evolutionary ecology of plants in
                  a fire environment are examined. The last two
                  chapters focus on changing patterns of fire in
                  modern landscapes and the use of fire in managing
                  ecosystems. Color photographs, graphs, sketches, and
                  other illustrations supplement the text. Subject and
                  species indices and a list of references are
                  provided at the end. This volume will benefit

                  temperature for 50% change in activity or cell death
                  (LT50) of leaves: (1) electrical conductivity

                  by 1 degrees-3 degrees C. For adults the LT50 ranged
                  from -5 degrees C for Rhus laurina in the summer to
                  -16 degrees C for Rhus ovata in the winter. The LT50

                  R. laurina and R. ovata underwent significant winter

                  central coast depends almost entirely on periodic,
                  stand-replacing fire. Compared to serotinous pines
                  of the Mediterranean Basin, little detailed
                  information is available on the postfire demography
                  of California closed-cone pines, including
                  P. coulteri. In September 1996 a wildfire burned the
                  760-ha American Canyon Research Natural Area (
                  RNA). Using aerial photography, we mapped burn
                  severity of P. coulteri-chaparral woodlands and
                  forests within the RNA. From May to September of
                  1997, we also quantified seedling establishment and
                  mortality in relation to biophysical site
                  characteristics including fire severity. Seventy-six
                  percent of P. coulteri forests and woodlands
                  experienced high-severity burns, 9%
                  moderate-severity burns, and 15% low-severity or
                  unburned. Of the 53 plots used for seedling counts,
                  70% were high-severity, 26% moderate-severity, and
                  4% low-severity. Seedling densities 13 months
                  postfire were low (0.21 m(-2)), but seedling
                  mortality also was low (8.4%). Aerial seed bank size
                  increased from north-facing to south-facing slopes
                  and from high-severity to low-severity
                  burns. Seedling recruitment was unrelated to burn
                  severity and increased with the size of the canopy
                  seed bank ( cone density). Many seedlings
                  established from rodent seed caches; 23% of the
                  seedlings established in clumps from seeds cached by
                  Dipodomys agilis, Chaetodipus californicus and
                  Peromyscus maniculatus. Pinus coulteri seeds have
                  low potential for dispersal by wind, but secondary
                  dispersal by rodents moves seeds away from source
                  trees and into neighboring chaparral. We discuss the
                  potential importance of rodent seed caching to
                  postfire demography of California and Mediterranean

  abstract =     {Populations of plants that rely on seeds for
                  recovery from disturbance by fire (obligate seeders)
                  are sensitive to regimes of frequent fire. Obligate
                  seeders are prominent in fire-prone heathlands of
                  southern Australia and South Africa. Population
                  extinction may occur if there are successive fires
                  during a plant's juvenile period. Research on the
                  population biology of obligate seeders has
                  influenced the management of fire in these heath and
                  shrublands, but work on the effects of the spatial
                  variability of fires is lacking. We hypothesize that
                  extinction may be avoided under an adverse fire
                  frequency if fires are patchy. We present a model
                  that simulates the effects of spatial and temporal
                  variations in fire regimes on the viability of a
                  plant populations in a grid landscape. Seedling
                  establishment, maturation, senescence, and seed
                  dispersal determine the presence of absence of
                  plants in each cell. We used values typical of
                  serotinous Banksia species to estimate probability
                  of extinction in relation to fire frequency, spatial
                  burning pattern and size variance, and the size of
                  the grid. Simulations 200 years in length indicated
                  that extinction probability was lowest when fire
                  frequency was intermediate and man fire size was
                  large. When fire frequency was high, extinction
                  probability was high irrespective of fire
                  size. Senescence was more important than
                  high-frequency fire as a cause of extinction in
                  cells. Interactions between dispersal, fire
                  frequency, and size were complex, indicating that
                  extinction is governed by interactions between
                  dispersal, fire frequency, and size were complex,
                  indicating that extinction is governed by intercell
                  connectivity. The model indicates that fire
                  patchiness cannot be assumed to ensure avoidance of
                  extinction of populations. Conservation of
                  populations is most likely when fire patchiness is
                  relatively low-when the size of fires is moderate to
                  large and when burned patches are contiguous.},

                  moisture and post-fire seed release from fruits as
                  determined by fire intensity, derived from field and
                  laboratory studies. Fires were simulated on the
                  first day of each calendar month for a 50-year
                  period. Levels of post-fire seedling emergence were
                  calculated using rainfall data from the Sydney
                  Observatory for the corresponding period
                  (1931-1980). Trends in seedling emergence as a
                  function of month of fire were examined. Alternative
                  sets of simulations were performed to assess the
                  effect of variations in post-dispersal seed
                  mortality, fire intensity and induced summer
                  dormancy. In both species, mean emergence was
                  affected by season of fire only when a 10% per month
                  level of post-dispersal seed mortality was simulated
                  (there was no fire-season effect at lower mortality
                  levels). Highest predicted emergence occurred after
                  summer fires and lowest emergence after winter
                  fires. A reduction in rate of seed release (lower
                  intensity fire) and induced seed dormancy in summer
                  also had a minor effect with respect to fire-season
                  in B. ericifolia. Reported levels of post-dispersal
                  seed mortality in Banksia species are often high and
                  therefore, the simulations suggested that there will
                  be an effect of fire season on seedling
                  emergence. However, given the high level of year to
                  year variation in seasonal rainfall in the Sydney
                  region, fire-season effects are not predictable in
                  the short term. In the longer term, the timing of
                  fire relative to sequences of wet and dry years may
                  be of equal importance to season of fire in its
                  effect on populations of these banksias.},

  abstract =     {Proliferation of woody plants in grasslands and
                  savannas since the 1800s has been widely
                  documented. In the southwestern United States,
                  increased abundance of honey mesquite (Prosopis
                  glandulosa var. glandulosa) has been attributed to
                  heavy grazing by livestock. Here, we test the
                  hypothesis that P. glandulosa invasion of grasslands
                  requires, first, reductions in herbaceous biomass
                  and density such as those that accompany livestock
                  grazing and, second, episodes of high soil moisture
                  availability. No combination of grass density
                  (nonmanipulated or reduced 50%) or defoliation
                  (none, moderate, heavy) significantly affected
                  P. glandulosa seedling emergence within a watering
                  regime (natural and supplemented) at our field site
                  in semiarid southern Texas. Seedling emergence on
                  plots receiving only natural rainfall was high
                  (42%), despite the fact that precipitation was
                  substantially below normal. Supplemental watering,
                  to generate moisture levels approximating years of
                  unusually high annual rainfall, increased emergence
                  to 59%. Seedling survival after 2 yr was high
                  (62-77%) and statistically comparable across the
                  density, defoliation, and watering treatments. Net
                  photosynthesis (A(n)) of 1-yr-old seedlings was
                  enhanced by supplemental watering, but reductions in
                  grass density or biomass had little effect on
                  seedling A(n) or xylem water potential. Height,
                  aboveground biomass, and leaf area were comparable
                  among 1- and 2-yr-old seedings across all density,
                  defoliation, and watering combinations. High
                  seedling emergence and survival on unwatered plots,
                  even during a ''drought year,'' suggests that
                  Prosopis recruitment is not contingent upon unusual
                  or episodic rainfall. Reductions in biomass and
                  density of herbaceous vegetation had no influence on
                  seedling emergence, growth, or survival, suggesting
                  that Prosopis invasion is minimally influenced by
                  grass competition. Historic grazing at this site
                  appears to have altered herbaceous composition and
                  reduced above- and belowground biomass production
                  below the threshold level required for competitive
                  exclusion of woody vegetation. Such data suggest
                  that rates and patterns of seed dispersal may be the
                  primary determinants of P. glandulosa encroachment
                  on present-day landscapes in semiarid
                  regions. Minimizing livestock dispersal of seed (in
                  the case of leguminous shrubs) and maintenance of an
                  effective fire regime (through production of fine
                  fuels) may be crucial for sustaining herbaceous
                  composition and production in grazed systems prone
                  to invasion by unpalatable woody plants.},

                  study, centuries-long patterns of fire events in a
                  montane ponderosa pine - Douglas-fir forest
                  landscape surrounding Cheesman Lake in central
                  Colorado were reconstructed from fire-scarred trees
                  and inferences from forest stand ages. We crossdated
                  153 fire-scarred trees from an approximately 4000 ha
                  study area that recorded 77 total fire years from
                  1197 to the present. Spatial extent of burned areas
                  during fire years varied from the scale of single
                  trees or small clusters of trees to fires that
                  burned across the entire landscape. Intervals
                  between fire years varied from 1 to 29 years across
                  the entire landscape to 3 to 58 years in one stand,
                  to over 100 years in other stands. Large portions of
                  the landscape did not record any fire for a 128
                  year-long period from 1723 to 1851. Fire severity
                  varied from low-intensity surface fires to
                  large-scale, stand-destroying fires, especially
                  during the 1851 fire year but also possibly during
                  other years. Fires occurred throughout tree growing
                  seasons and both before and after growing
                  seasons. These results suggest that the fire regime
                  has varied considerably across the study area during
                  the past several centuries. Since fires influence
                  plant establishment and mortality on the landscape,
                  these results further suggest that vegetation
                  patterns changed at multiple scales during this
                  period. The fire history from Cheesman Lake
                  documents a greater range in fire behavior in
                  ponderosa pine forests than generally has been found

                  forest was examined for tree recruitment
                  patterns. Reconstructed mean surface fire intervals
                  and Weibull median probability intervals ranged from
                  similar to 7 to similar to 13 years. Fires generally
                  occurred late in the growing season or after growth
                  had ceased for a year. Spatial patterns of historic
                  fires and those reconstructed from the fire-scar
                  record document often widespread fires in the
                  central Olema Valley. Likely many, if not most, of
                  the fires reconstructed from Point Reyes were
                  ignited by humans given the long history of
                  intensive use of this area, first by the Coast Miwok
                  and later by European ranchers. Age structures of
                  stands suggest that much of the Douglas-fir
                  overstory is multiaged with little evidence of
                  stand-replacing fin or other disturbance
                  events. Ages of trees in Douglas-fir stands document
                  increasing landscape coverage of Douglas-fir forest
                  at Point Reyes and hardwood recruitment under older
                  Douglas-fu canopies, and suggest that loss of
                  surface fires is having cascading effects on
                  landscape vegetation patterns, community
                  relationships, and probably related ecosystem
                  processes.},

                  sempervirens (D.Don.)Endl.) in and near Redwood
                  National Park were dendrochronologically cross-dated
                  and used to develop a fire history from 1714 to
                  1985. A master chronology for the study area was
                  first developed from old-growth trees and provided
                  dating control for fire-scarred samples. Redwood
                  offers a challenge for dendrochronology owing to
                  partially absent rings (ring wedging) and uniform
                  ring widths (complacency). Cross dating was
                  successful in portions of 12 of 24 fire-scarred
                  trees. Fire events were dated by noting the position
                  of fire scars and other fire-associated ring
                  structures (resin ducts, double latewood, growth
                  releases, and ring separations) in the cross-dated
                  ring series. Using only dates of fire scars, the
                  mean fire interval (MFI) was 9.9 years from the
                  first recorded fire in 1714 to the last in 1962. The
                  MFI was 8.0 years for the best represented (greatest
                  sample depth) presettlement period from 1714 to
                  1881. Using dates for all fire-associated ring
                  features, the MFI from 1714 to 1962 was 7.0 years
                  and from 1714 to 1881 was 6.0 years. Use of all
                  fire-associated ring characteristics is argued to be
                  a more complete representation of past fire
                  frequency due to possible under-representation of
                  fire-scar records from stump-top samples. Based upon
                  scar positions within annual rings, fires occurred
                  predominately late in the growing season or after
                  growth ceased for the year. The mean fire intervals
                  determined are shorter than those reported in all
                  except one other fire history study from coast
                  redwood and suggest that fire frequency in redwood
                  may have been underestimated in many past studies.},

                  the dynamics of the canopy-stored seed banks of two
                  Australian obligate seeder shrubs, Petrophile
                  sessilis and Hakea sericea (Proteaceae), with the
                  objective of determining the changes in viable seed
                  supply over a year. 2 The total number of germinable
                  seeds in the canopy, each month for 12 months during
                  1996-97, was estimated from separate measures of (i)
                  pre-dispersal predation of fruits; (ii) seed
                  predation of insect parasitoids; (iii) viability of
                  intact seeds; and (iv) loss of seed viability
                  following experimental heating. 3 The two species
                  had very different seed bank dynamics throughout the
                  year. The seed store of P. sessilis appeared to be
                  being replaced annually, as seeds in the older
                  fruits rapidly lost germinability and new fruits
                  matured to replace them. For H. sericea, the seed
                  store appeared to be accumulating each year, because
                  older fruits retained a high level of
                  germinability. 4 The study indicates that no one
                  fire season will maximize the germinable seed
                  release after fire for all species. Management
                  strategies should therefore include varied seasons
                  of prescribed burning to avoid compositional change
                  and a decrease in diversity that may result from a
                  single-season approach.},

  abstract =     {The idea that sex functions to provide variation for
                  natural selection to act upon was first advocated by
                  August Weismann and it has dominated much discussion
                  on the evolution of sex and recombination since
                  then. The goal of this paper is to further extend
                  this hypothesis and to assess its place in a larger
                  body of theory on the evolution of sex and
                  recombination. A simple generic model is developed
                  to show how fitness variation and covariation
                  interact with selection for recombination and
                  illustrate some important implications of the
                  hypothesis: (1) the advantage of sex and
                  recombination can accrue both to reproductively
                  isolated populations and to modifiers segregating
                  within populations, but the former will be much
                  larger than the latter; (2) forces of degradation
                  that are correlated across loci within an individual
                  can reduce or reverse selection for increased
                  recombination; and (3) crossing-over (which can
                  occur at different places in different meioses) will
                  create more variability than having multiple
                  chromosomes and so will have more influence on the
                  efficacy of selection. Several long-term selection
                  experiments support Weismann's hypothesis, including
                  those showing a greater response to selection in
                  populations with higher rates of recombination and
                  higher rates of recombination evolving as a
                  correlated response to selection for some other
                  character. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent
                  with the sporadic distribution of obligate
                  asexuality, which indicates that clones have a
                  higher rate of extinction than sexuals. Weismann's
                  hypothesis is then discussed in light of other
                  patterns in the distribution of sexuality versus
                  asexuality. To account for variation in the
                  frequency of obligate asexuality in different taxa,
                  a simple model is developed in which this frequency
                  is a function of three parameters: the rate of
                  clonal origin, the initial fitness of clones when
                  they arise, and the rate at which that fitness
                  declines over time. Variation in all three
                  parameters is likely to be important in explaining
                  the distribution of obligate asexuality. Facultative
                  asexuality also exists, and for this to be stable it
                  seems there must br ecological differences between
                  the sexual and as well as genetic
                  differences. Finally, the timing of sex in cyclical
                  parthenogens is most likely set to minimize the
                  opportunity costs of sex. None of these patterns
                  contradict Weismann's hypothesis, but they do show
                  that many additional principles unrelated to the
                  function of sex are required to fully explain its
                  distribution. Weismann's hypothesis is also
                  consistent with what we know about the mechanics and
                  molecular genetics of recombination, in particular
                  the tendency for chromatids to recombine with a
                  homolog rather than a sister chromatid at meiosis,
                  which is opposite to what they do during
                  mitosis. However, molecular genetic studies have
                  shown that cis-acting sites at which recombination
                  is initiated are lost by gene conversion as a
                  result, a factor that can be expected to affect many
                  fine details in the evolution of recombination. In
                  summary, although Weismann's hypothesis must be
                  considered the leading candidate for the function of
                  sex and recombination, nevertheless, many additional
                  principles are needed to fully account for their
                  evolution.},

                  respiration after clipping the tops at different
                  frequencies. 2. After a single clipping, Arbutus
                  showed a 29% decrease of phosphorus concentration by
                  the end of the first growing season. Two years after
                  recovery from clipping, the starch levels remained
                  lower than those of unclipped plants. Similarly,
                  Erica showed depletion of starch, but no nutrient
                  reserves were depleted significantly. 3. Regrowth
                  after multiple clippings mobilized a large fraction
                  of the starch and nutri ents stored in the
                  lignotuber. Mean starch concentrations were depleted

  abstract =     {1 Both fire regimes and the conditions under which
                  fires occur vary widely. Abiotic conditions (such as
                  climate) in combination with fire season, frequency
                  and intensity could influence vegetation responses
                  to fire. A variety of adaptations facilitate
                  post-fire recruitment in mediterranean climate
                  ecosystems, but responses of other communities are
                  less well known. We evaluated the importance of
                  climate by comparing sites with mediterranean and
                  subtropical climates. 2 We used paired burned and
                  mature sites in chamise chaparral, mixed chaparral
                  and coastal sage scrub (California), and rosemary
                  scrub, sand pine scrub and sandhill (Florida), to
                  test whether (i) patterns of pre-fire and post-fire
                  seedling recruitment are more similar between
                  communities within a region than between regions,
                  and (ii) post-fire stimulation of seedling
                  establishment is greater in regions with marked
                  fire-induced contrasts in abiotic site
                  characteristics. 3 Post-fire seedling densities were
                  more similar among sites within climatic regions
                  than between regions. Both seedling densities and
                  proportions of species represented by seedlings
                  after fires were generally higher in California. 4
                  The only site characteristic showing a
                  pre-fire-post-fire contrast was percentage open
                  canopy, and the effect was greater in California
                  than in Florida. Soil properties were unaffected by
                  fire. 5 Mediterranean climate ecosystems in other
                  regions have nutrient-poor soils similar to our
                  subtropical Florida sites, but show post-fire
                  seedling recruitment patterns more similar to the
                  nutrient-rich sites in California. Climate therefore
                  appears to play a more major role than soil

                  and transmission. The main difference with other
                  models for fire prediction and simulation is that,
                  here, fire is an endogenous variable with purely
                  deterministic dynamics. Nevertheless, the analysis
                  shows that fire recurrence can be chaotic for
                  parameter values corresponding to Mediterranean
                  forests. By contrast, the model shows that boreal
                  forests and savannas have the tendency to experience
                  periodic fires. These general results are in

  abstract =     {Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly
                  determined by an interplay between the abiotic
                  environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane
                  argued that species' ranges could be set
                  intraspecifically when gene flow from a species'
                  populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the
                  periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have
                  modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative
                  genetic model that combines density-dependent local
                  population growth with dispersal and gene flow
                  across a linear environmental gradient in optimum
                  phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have
                  extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include
                  interspecific competition and the
                  frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as
                  well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative
                  character. Our model includes local population
                  growth, movements over space, natural selection, and
                  gene now. It simultaneously addresses the evolution
                  of character displacement and species borders. It
                  reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single-species
                  result that limited ranges can be produced with
                  sufficiently steep environmental gradients and
                  strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of
                  environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal,
                  interspecific competition will not limit species
                  ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However,
                  interspecific competition can interact with
                  environmental gradients and gene flow to generate
                  limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and
                  dispersal parameters than in the single-species
                  case. Species display character displacement in
                  sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that
                  results from this displacement does nor necessarily
                  allow the two species to become sympatric
                  everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces
                  population densities in the region of overlap,
                  which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene
                  flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability
                  of each species to adapt to local physical
                  conditions at their range limits. If environmental
                  gradients are monotonic but not linear, the
                  transition zone between species at coevolutionary
                  equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient
                  is steepest. If productivity gradients are also
                  introduced into the model, then patterns similar to
                  Rapoport's rule emerge. Interacting species respond
                  to climate change, as it affects the optimal
                  phenotype over space, by a combination of range
                  shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype, while
                  solitary species respond solely by range
                  shifts. Finally, we compare empirical estimates for
                  intrinsic growth rates and diffusion coefficients
                  for several species to those needed by the
                  single-species model to produce a stable limited
                  range. These empirical values are generally
                  insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model
                  suggesting a role for interspecific interactions.},

                  Occidental (Argentina), agroforestry systems
                  applying different ways of management are under
                  evaluation. To increase the capacity of art area to
                  support more animals per unit area, shrubs are
                  removed by clearcutting at ground level. Among these
                  shrubs are atamisqui (Capparis atamisquea O. Ktze.,
                  Capparidaceae), jarilla (Larrea divaricata Cav.,
                  Zygophyllaceae), and teatin (Acacia furcatispina
                  Burk., Leguminosae). These shrubs are remarkable
                  because they have high density, frequency and
                  coverage, high resprouting capability and fast
                  biomass recovery. However, there is very little
                  information about them. The evaluation of the
                  carbohydrate dynamics in native shrubs of the Chaco
                  Occidental region has not been studied
                  yet. Knowledge of seasonal variation of root
                  carbohydrates in these species may be an important
                  aspect to consider in the timing of clearcutting
                  practice. In this study, three individuals of each
                  species were sampled monthly, and starch and soluble
                  sugars were determined. Starch plus soluble sugar
                  comprise the total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC)
                  fraction. Results showed that the minimal TNC was
                  observed during flowering for atamisqui and teatin,
                  and during fruiting for jarilla, which coincided
                  with the high rainfall of the early Summer. There
                  were significant (P<0.01) differences in the TNC
                  levels between dry- and wet season-atamisqui (257
                  and 183 mu g/mg dry weight), jarilla (196 and 135)
                  and teatin (303 and 231), respectively. Therefore,
                  the time of low TNC and consequently the best time
                  to cut occurs during the time of highest
                  precipitation, when plants have exhausted
                  carbohydrate reserves from their roots to resprout
                  and flower.},

                  moving optimum, under light conditions. The
                  conditions are much more stringent with a cyclical
                  or randomly varying environment, especially if the
                  autocorrelation for a random environment is
                  small. The conditions for spread of a rare modifier
                  affecting the rate of genetic recombination are also
                  examined, and the strength of selection on such a
                  modifier determined. Again, the case of a steadily
                  moving optimum is most favourable for the evolution
                  of increased recombination. The selection pressure
                  on a recombination modifier when a trait is subject
                  to strong truncation selection is calculated, and
                  shown to be large enough to account for observed
                  increases in recombination associated with
                  artificial selection. Theoretical and empirical
                  evidence relevant to evaluating the importance of
                  this model for the evolution of sex and
                  recombination is discussed.},

  abstract =     {Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of
                  species diversity within ecological communities of
                  sessile organisms include niche differentiation
                  mediated by competitive trade-offs, frequency
                  dependence resulting from species-specific pests,
                  recruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a
                  speciation-extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated
                  by stochasticity (drift). While each of these
                  processes, and more, have been shown to act in
                  particular communities, much remains to be learned
                  about their relative importance in shaping
                  community-level patterns. We used a
                  spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess
                  the effects of each of these processes on species
                  richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns
                  such as the species-area curve. Our model
                  communities had an order-of-magnitude more
                  individuals than any previous such study, and we
                  also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to
                  infer the large-scale properties of these systems in
                  order to establish the generality of our conclusions
                  across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can
                  promote diversity. We found some qualitative
                  differences in community patterns across communities
                  in which different combinations of these mechanisms
                  operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with
                  short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with
                  global dispersal. Relative-abundance distributions
                  are more even for systems with competitive
                  differences and trade-offs than for those in which
                  all species are competitively equivalent, and they
                  are most even when frequency dependence (even if
                  weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in
                  which different processes operated showed
                  surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that
                  the form of community-level patterns cannot in
                  general be used to distinguish among mechanisms
                  maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless,
                  parameterization of models such as these from field
                  data on the strengths of the different mechanisms
                  could yield insight into their relative roles in
                  diversity maintenance in any given community.},

                  community is investigated by means of a forest
                  growth simulator called TROLL. This simulator makes
                  it possible to investigate impacts on the spatial
                  distribution and the extinction probability of plant
                  species. I present the results of a two-species
                  competition scenario. Coexistence is found to be
                  possible for competitively dissimilar species, and
                  the criterion for this coexistence is given
                  analytically in the reaction-diffusion
                  approximation. A higher frequency of tree falls
                  implies a smaller extinction probability of least
                  adapted species. The multispecies model is also
                  investigated. A mathematical quantity-the
                  persistence function-permits measurement of the
                  ability of a species to out compete other species
                  locally. This quantity is compared with the average
                  time to extinction, and it is computed for the TROLL
                  simulator. I interpret the shape of this function in
                  light of available information on the persistence
                  function in simple interacting particle
                  systems. These results indicate an analogy between
                  the dynamics of forest communities and a simple
                  discrete and spatially explicit model, the voter
                  model. The ecological implications of this analogy
                  are discussed and are extended to species-rich
                  communities.},

                  Hubbell's (2001) neutral theory of species abundance
                  for ecological communities, and clarify its
                  historical connections with closely related
                  approaches in population genetics. A selective
                  overview of the empirical evidence for and against
                  this theory is provided, with a special emphasis on
                  tropical plant communities. The neutral theory
                  predicts many of the basic patterns of biodiversity,
                  confirming its heuristic power. The strict
                  assumption of equivalence that defines neutrality,
                  equivalence among individuals, finds little
                  empirical support in general. However, a weaker
                  assumption holds for stable communities, the
                  equivalence of average fitness among species. One
                  reason for the surprising success of the neutral
                  theory is that all the theories of species
                  coexistence satisfying the fitness equivalence
                  assumption, including many theories of niche
                  differentiation, generate exactly the same patterns
                  as the neutral theory. Hubbell's neutral theory
                  represents an important synthesis and a much needed
                  demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific
                  variability in ecology. Further improvements should
                  lead to an explicit linking to niche-based
                  processes. This research programme will depend
                  crucially on forthcoming theoretical and empirical
                  achievements.},

                  northeastern Costa Rica. Based on quantitative
                  sampling of seedlings, saplings, and trees, we
                  assess whether particular sexual systems,
                  pollination syndromes, or seed-dispersal modes are
                  associated With successional stage, prior selective
                  logging, woody growth forms, or patterns of
                  abundance or rarity. We further examine the
                  phylogenetic structure of these traits in the
                  regional woody flora, testing explicit hypotheses
                  regarding phylogenctic clustering of reproductive
                  traits and habitat distributions. Animal dispersal
                  and insect pollination predominate across
                  all. forest types and size classes. In second-growth
                  trees, relative abundance of species with explosive
                  dispersal, hermaphroditic flowers, and insect
                  pollination is higher, and relative abundance of
                  species with animal dispersal and mammal pollination
                  is lower, compared to old-growth and logged
                  forests. Overall, dioecy and wind dispersal are more
                  frequent than expected in canopy trees, and
                  hermaphroditic flowers are more frequent than
                  expected in shrubs. Reproductive traits, growth-form
                  traits, and relative abundance patterns show
                  significant clustering within the supertree
                  phylogeny. Patterns of trait distribution across
                  forest types are closely linked with patterns of
                  floristic composition at the genus and family
                  level. Species-level associations among reproductive
                  traits and woody growth form can be explained by
                  phylogenetic correlations. Wind dispersal and
                  hummingbird pollination are significantly
                  concentrated in clades with hermaphroditic flowers,
                  whereas wind pollination is concentrated in clades
                  with unisexual flowers. Legacies of both
                  phylogenetic history and forest disturbance
                  structure the distribution of reproductive traits

                  species coexistence, which may be stable or
                  unstable, Stable coexistence can be quantified by
                  the long-term rates at which community members
                  recover from low density. Quantification shows that
                  coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways:
                  They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to
                  minimize average fitness differences between
                  species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to
                  increase negative intraspecific interactions
                  relative to negative interspecific
                  interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential
                  for species coexistence and include traditional
                  mechanisms such as resource partitioning and
                  frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms
                  that depend on fluctuations in population densities
                  and environmental factors in space and
                  time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable
                  coexistence because they reduce large average
                  fitness inequalities which might negate the effects
                  of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable
                  coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays
                  over time, have focused almost exclusively on
                  equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more
                  robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms,
                  which arise in many and varied ways but need not be
                  adequate for full stability of a system. Models of
                  unstable coexistence invite a broader view of
                  diversity maintenance incorporating species
                  turnover.},

                  Minnesota to determine the extent to which
                  disturbance controls species composition. The model
                  assumes fires ate necessary for recruitment, and
                  they may cause mortality, depending on species,
                  Reproductive success is estimated as an integral
                  equation (analogous to Lotka's equation for R(0))
                  taking into account fecundity schedules, mortality
                  schedules, and age-specific disturbance effects,
                  Life histories are parameterized for the three
                  dominant fire-dependent tree taxa in the region,
                  Pinus resinosa, Betula papyrifera, and
                  Populus. Long-term disturbance regimes are
                  summarized as density functions of intervals between
                  fires parameterized from fire scars on trees and in
                  sediment charcoal records. Changes in the density of
                  fire intervals in the past are the basis for
                  predictions that different taxa would dominate,
                  depending on their life histories, Fossil pollen
                  data indicate changing abundances of tree taxa and
                  are used to test predictions of the model of
                  reproductive success. Comparisons of model
                  predictions with changing abundances of pollen
                  indicate that the density of fire regimes is one of
                  the important controls on composition. Pinus
                  resinosa is limited by the high frequency of fire,
                  but longevity is an advantage in the region for this
                  species; Betula is limited by frequent fire, and
                  longevity is of little advantage; and Populus is
                  least sensitive to fire regime. Results show that
                  knowing simply the frequency of fire can lead to
                  naive interpretations of fire effects (or lack
                  thereof). The higher moments of disturbance
                  densities can be critical for understanding
                  responses of species that require extended intervals
                  to achieve resistance to fire. These extended
                  intervals may be race, in which case they are better
                  described by the higher moments of the density than
                  they are by the mean interval.},

                  ability of plant species to resprout has been
                  explored more in terms of disturbance frequency than
                  of resource gradients, and has rarely been examined
                  in non-Mediterranean landscapes. 2 The fire response
                  of 296 non-eucalypt woody taxa was recorded in five
                  habitats in the New England Tablelands (NET)
                  Bioregion of eastern Australia: grassy woodlands,
                  dry sclerophyll forests, rocky outcrops, wet heaths
                  and wet sclerophyll forests. We then tested whether
                  there was a dichotomy of response to crown fire,
                  whether the proportion of resprouters differed among
                  habitats, and if disturbance frequency or
                  resource-productivity models could account for
                  landscape patterns of resprouting. 3 There was a
                  continuum of sprouting ability but most species
                  could be classified as obligate seeders (killed by
                  fire) or resprouters. Habitats differed in the
                  proportion of resprouting species, with rocky
                  outcrops having the lowest proportion and grassy
                  forests and wet heaths the highest. This pattern was
                  consistent at the congeneric and confamilar
                  phylogenetic levels of comparison. 4
                  Resource/productivity models better explained
                  landscape patterns of resprouting than disturbance
                  frequency models. There was a strong positive
                  relationship between resprouting and increasing soil
                  fertility and moisture gradients. Species richness
                  and obligate seeder richness increased with climate
                  variability and landscape heterogeneity. 5 Landscape
                  resprouting patterns were explained by a
                  resource-competition model where resprouters are
                  favoured because of their ability to persist in more
                  competitive environments. Overall, we suggest that
                  disturbance frequency has larger effects on species
                  richness at the low end of the productivity gradient
                  than at the high end.},

                  for insularity in taxon composition and functional
                  traits. The outcrops and matrix had similar
                  reproduction, gender, life span, and growth form
                  traits, being dominated by co-sexual sclerophyll
                  shrubs. The outcrops, however, were dissimilar in
                  species composition and functional traits forming an
                  archipelago of habitat islands in a forest
                  matrix. Rank abundance curves were less even on rock
                  outcrops than in adjacent forests, being dominated
                  by shrubs that were killed by fire (obligate
                  seeders). The ratio of shrubs killed by fire
                  (obligate seeders) to resprouters was 70:30 on the
                  outcrops compared with 38:62 in the matrix. Evidence
                  for functional convergence in fire response traits
                  comes from 27 genera, in 17 families, which have
                  congeners in each habitat. Most shrub congeners on
                  or near rocky outcrops were killed by fire whereas
                  related taxa in the forests resprout after
                  fire. Functional convergence can be related to
                  disturbance frequency and/or differences in
                  regeneration niche among habitats. A resprouting
                  response appears to be related to more frequent
                  fires in the matrix as outcrops experience fires
                  less often. The dominance of obligate seeding shrubs
                  on high rainfall outcrops may also be related to
                  better resources in an environment where allocation
                  to growth rather than storage could be
                  advantageous. In drier and shadier habitats,
                  however, resprouting may be promoted over seedling
                  recruitment as the risks of recruitment failure are
                  higher.},

                  ravines, can act as habitat islands in fire-prone
                  vegetation by influencing the fire regime. In
                  coastal and sub-coastal areas of Australia, rock
                  outcrops and pavements form potential habitat
                  islands in a matrix of fire-prone eucalypt
                  forests. The aim of this study was to compare
                  floristic composition and fire response traits of
                  plants occurring on rocky areas and contrast them
                  with the surrounding matrix. Methods Patterns of
                  plant community composition and fire response were
                  compared between rocky areas and surrounding
                  sclerophyll forests in a range of climate types to
                  test for differences. Classification and ordination
                  were used to compare floristic composition and
                  univariate analyses were used to compare fire
                  response traits. Results The rock outcrops and
                  pavements were dissimilar in species composition
                  from the forest matrix but shared genera and
                  families with the matrix. Outcrops and pavements
                  were dominated by scleromorphic shrubs that were
                  mainly killed by fire and had post-fire seedling
                  recruitment (obligate seeders). In contrast, the
                  most abundant species in the adjacent forest matrix
                  were species that sprout after fire
                  (sprouters). Main conclusions Fire frequency and
                  intensity are likely to be less on outcrops than in
                  the forest matrix because the physical barrier of
                  rock edges disrupts fires. Under the regime of more
                  frequent fires, obligate seeders have been removed
                  or reduced in abundance from the forest matrix. This
                  process may have also operated over evolutionary
                  time-scales and resulted in convergence towards
                  obligate seeding traits on outcrop fire shadows. In
                  contrast, there may have been convergence towards
                  sprouting in the forest matrix as a result of
                  selection for persistence under a regime of frequent
                  fire.},

                  wind-dispersed pines (Pinus) have spines on their
                  scales as a putative form of defense against seed
                  predators. We tested whether spines differentially
                  deterred seed predators foraging on closed and open
                  pine cones. Red Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) were
                  selected as the seed predator because they commonly
                  forage on these cones. We timed crossbills foraging
                  on closed and open pine cones with and without
                  spines. Crossbills did not require more time to
                  remove seeds from closed ponderosa pine
                  (P. ponderosa) cones with spines. However,
                  crossbills required significantly more time (18-34%)
                  to remove seeds from open ponderosa pine and Table
                  Mountain pine (P. pungens) cones with spines than
                  from cones whose spines had been removed. Moreover,
                  experiments designed to isolate the effect of spines
                  on the perching and probing behavior of crossbills
                  revealed that spines hindered both activities
                  additively. These experimental results were
                  consistent with our phylogenetic analyses of 21
                  species of hard pines (subgenus Pinus). Whereas the
                  evolution of changes in the length of time seeds are
                  retained in closed cones and that of changes in the
                  presence of spines appear independent, changes in
                  the length of time seeds are retained in open cones

                  were reconstructed from a 3600-yr core from Los
                  Penasquitos Lagoon using fossil pollen, spores,
                  charcoal, chemical stratigraphy, particle size, and
                  magnetic susceptibility. Late Holocene sediments
                  were radiocarbon dated, while the historical
                  sediments were dated using sediment chemistry,
                  fossil pollen, and historical records. At 3600 yr
                  B.P., the estuary was a brackish-water lagoon. By
                  2800 yr B.P,, Poaceae (grass) pollen increased to
                  high levels, suggesting that the rising level of the
                  core site led to its colonization by Spartina
                  foliosa (cord-grass), the lowest-elevation plant
                  type within regional estuaries. An increase in
                  pollen and spores of moisture-dependent species
                  suggests a climate with more available moisture
                  after 2600 yr B.P. This change is similar to that
                  found 280 km to the north at 3250 yr B.P., implying
                  that regional climate changes were
                  time-transgressive from north to south. Increased
                  postsettlement sediment input resulted from
                  nineteenth-century land disturbances caused by
                  grazing and fire. Sedimentation rates increased
                  further in the twentieth century due to closure of
                  the estuarine mouth. The endemic Pinus torreyana
                  (Torrey pine) was present at the site throughout
                  this 3600-yr interval but was less numerous prior to
                  2100 yr B.P. This history may have contributed to
                  the low genetic diversity of this species. (C) 2000

                  variable in response to a variety of biotic and
                  abiotic forces. It is not always cleat, however, if
                  spatial and temporal variability leads to
                  instability in communities. Instability may result
                  from strong biotic interactions or from stochastic
                  processes acting on small populations. I used 10-15
                  yr of annual data from the Konza Prairie Long-Term
                  Ecological Research site to examine whether plant,
                  breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal
                  communities in tallgrass prairie exhibit stability
                  or directional change in response to different
                  experimentally induced fire frequencies. Based on
                  ordination and ANOVA, plant and grasshopper
                  communities on annually burned sites differed
                  significantly from plant and grasshopper communities
                  on less frequently burned sites. Breeding birds and
                  small mammals differed among sites as well, but
                  these differences were not clearly related to
                  disturbance frequency A modified time series
                  analysis indicated that plant communities were
                  undergoing directional change (unstable) on all
                  watersheds, regardless of fire frequency. Contrary
                  to expectations, directional change was greatest on
                  the annually burned sites and lowest on the
                  infrequently burned sites. Unlike the plant
                  communities, breeding bird. grasshopper, and small
                  mammal communities were temporally stable, despite
                  high-compositional variability from 1 yr to the
                  next. Stability among the consumer communities
                  within these dynamic plant communities occurs
                  because three-dimensional vegetation structure does
                  not change over time, despite changes in plant
                  species composition. Evidence suggests that
                  instability in the plant community results from
                  strong biotic interactions among temporally
                  persistent core species and stochastic dynamics
                  among infrequent satellite species. Overall,
                  community stability cannot be assessed if the
                  pattern of temporal dynamics is unknown. Long-term
                  empirical studies of different taxa under different
                  disturbance regimes are needed to determine over
                  what time frames and spatial scales communities may
                  be stable. Such studies are essential for the
                  development of generalities regarding the
                  relationship between disturbance frequency and
                  community stability in terrestrial and aquatic

                  (surrounded by Fynbos on acid sand) and
                  equivalent-sized areas of mainland indicated a weak
                  fragmentation effect on overall species
                  richness. There was no difference between mainland
                  and island floras in the frequency of species
                  belonging to different dispersal types, pollination
                  syndromes, growth forms and shrub height
                  categories. This probably results from islands being
                  exposed to the same disturbance (fire) regime and
                  being accessible to similar pollination and
                  dispersal vectors as the mainland. A fragmentation
                  effect was also diluted by the establishment on

                  suggest that the minimum reserve size needed to

                  about 4-15 ha. This is encouraging since c. 90% of

                  regeneration traits which facilitate competition for
                  space. Lottery and regeneration niche models can
                  explain the coexistence of functionally analagous
                  proteoid and ericoid shrubs. The diversity of
                  regeneration traits within functional types provides
                  a 'backup' in the event of fire-related stochastic
                  population fluctuations. This ensures long-term
                  stability of community structure, possibly
                  maintaining functional diversity and ecosystem
                  processes. Research to test hypotheses on the
                  relationships between species diversify and
                  ecosystem processes in fynbos communities may lack a
                  tractable protocol; some directions are, however,

                  patterns of plants in fire-prone
                  environments. However, it is not known whether such
                  trade-offs exist in plants which after aboveground
                  removing disturbances, such as fire, may regenerate
                  by sexual (seeding) or asexual (sprouting)
                  mechanisms. We evaluated whether in the
                  fire-recruiting resprouter Erica australis, which
                  after fire can regenerate by seedling establishment
                  or resprouting, a larger investment in flowers and
                  seeds prior to being disturbed by clipping its
                  aboveground parts would decrease subsequent
                  sprouting, that is, its vegetative regeneration
                  capacity. We analysed the relationships between
                  flower and seed production and the ensuing
                  production and growth of sprouts of six plants from
                  thirteen different sites in central-western
                  Spain. We found no significant relationships between
                  measures of sexual reproductive effort and resprout
                  production and growth 6 months after clipping the
                  aboveground parts of the plants. No evidence of
                  trade-offs between sexual and asexual efforts was
                  found. Furthermore, no significant relationship was
                  found between lignotuber total non-structural
                  carbohydrates and sexual reproductive effort. In
                  addition, 2 years after the disturbance, resprout
                  biomass was positively and significantly correlated
                  with sexual reproductive effort prior to the
                  disturbance. This indicates that growth of resprouts
                  was higher at the sites where plants made a greater
                  reproductive effort. The sites that were more
                  favourable to producing flowers and seeds could also
                  be more favourable to resprouting. (C) 2001 Editions

                  can accelerate disturbance regimes and facilitate
                  colonization by other normative species. In a
                  coastal grassland in northern California, we
                  conducted a four-year exclosure experiment to assess
                  the effects of soil disturbances by feral pigs (Sus
                  scrofa) on plant community composition and soil
                  nitrogen availability. Our results indicate that pig
                  disturbances had substantial effects on the
                  community, although many responses varied with plant
                  functional group, geographic origin (native
                  vs. exotic), and grassland type. ("Short patches"
                  were dominated by annual grasses and forbs, whereas
                  "tall patches" were dominated by perennial
                  bunchgrasses.) Soil disturbances by pigs increased
                  the richness of exotic plant species by 29% and
                  native taxa by 24%. Although native perennial
                  grasses were unaffected, disturbances reduced the
                  biomass of exotic perennial grasses by 52% in tall
                  patches and had no effect in short patches. Pig
                  disturbances led to a 69% decrease in biomass of
                  exotic annual grasses in tall patches but caused a
                  62% increase in short patches. Native, nongrass
                  monocots exhibited the opposite biomass pattern as
                  those seen for exotic annual grasses, with
                  disturbance causing an 80% increase in tall patches
                  and a 56% decrease in short patches. Native forbs
                  were unaffected by disturbance, whereas the biomass
                  of exotic forbs increased by 79% with disturbance in
                  tall patches and showed no response in short
                  patches. In contrast to these vegetation results, we
                  found no evidence that pig disturbances affected
                  nitrogen mineralization rates or soil moisture
                  availability. Thus, we hypothesize that the observed
                  vegetation changes were due to space clearing by
                  pigs that provided greater opportunities for
                  colonization and reduced intensity of competition,
                  rather than changes in soil characteristics. In
                  summary, although responses were variable,
                  disturbances by feral pigs generally promoted the
                  continued invasion of this coastal grassland by
                  exotic plant taxa.},

  abstract =     {Progressive diebacks of outer canopy branchlets of
                  Ceanothus crassifolius were repeatedly observed
                  after rainless periods up to 9 mo in duration in the
                  Santa Monica Mountains of southern California. Mean
                  xylem pressures of branchlets near the end of
                  drought were as low as -11.2 MPa (N = 22) with a
                  mean of about 60 dead branchlets per
                  shrub. Inoculation (N = 15) with three species of
                  fungi previously isolated from the same population
                  of C. crassifolius did not promote dieback,
                  suggesting that the observed decline was not fungal
                  induced, as had been proposed. Further, at least 50%
                  of healthy-appearing twigs, without symptoms of
                  dieback, contained isolatible endophytic fungi. We
                  used a centrifugal force method to determine the
                  range of xylem pressure causing cavitation
                  (vulnerability curves) for branchlets (N = 12) and
                  roots (N = 16). We combined vulnerability curves
                  with soil texture data (N = 6) into a water
                  transport model that estimated the critical values
                  (P-Lerit) of leaf xylem pressure associated with the
                  loss of water from soil to foliage. Maximum P-Lerit
                  was between -10 and -11 MPa and within the range of
                  minimum measured xylem pressures of branchlets
                  during drought and dieback. Branchlet dieback
                  correlated with seasonal declines in xylem pressure
                  in concert with declining safety margins from
                  hydraulic failure. Symptoms of dieback were
                  duplicated in the field by partially severing stem
                  xylem that normally supplied branchlets with
                  water. Taken together, these results indicate that
                  loss of hydraulic conductance to foliage was the
                  probable cause of the observed dieback in
                  C. crassifolius. Partial dieback of peripheral
                  branchlets, and its attendant reduction in
                  evaporative surface area, may be a last-resort
                  mechanism for whole-plant water conservation and
                  drought survival in this species.},

                  affecting Mediterranean ecosystems. Both of them are
                  closely related to climate. There is evidence of
                  decreasing precipitation in the Mediterranean,
                  particularly during summer. There are also
                  indications of an increased variability in the
                  rainfall distribution. Climatic changes, though show
                  high heterogeneity at a local scale. Based on these
                  observations, we have evaluated the following
                  hypotheses for the Region of Valencia (East
                  Spain). (1) During the past three decades, climatic
                  conditions have become more favourable for wildfires
                  and high erosivity rainfall events. We have used
                  30-year climate records from 97 meteorological
                  stations to examine this. Results indicate that in
                  general the hypothesis is true, although trends are
                  spatially dependent. (2) The effect of high
                  intensity rain on burned land may substantially
                  affect short-term ecosystem composition and
                  function, and thus successional trajectories. Based
                  on a plot scale study, we have assessed nutrient and
                  vegetation dynamics after burning a pyrophytic
                  community dominated by gorse (Ulex
                  parviflorus). Erosion following high intensity
                  rainfall affects physicochemical soil properties. As
                  a consequence, plant cover is reduced and specific
                  composition affected, changing the previous
                  relationship between obligate seeder and resprouter
                  species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

                  studied at the stand level in many types of
                  terrestrial ecosystems, but factors controlling
                  regeneration at the landscape scale are less well
                  known. Over large areas, fire history, climate,
                  topography, and dominant type of vegetation may
                  affect postfire response. Increased fire frequency,
                  as is occurring in some mediterranean-type
                  ecosystems, may reduce ecosystem resilience, i.e.,
                  the ability to recover the pre-disturbance state. We
                  used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
                  (NDVI) from Landsat imagery to monitor vegetation
                  recovery after Successive fires in a 32 100-km(2)
                  area of Catalonia (northeastern Spain) between 1975
                  and 1993. In areas burned twice, NDVI patterns
                  indicated that regrowth after 70 mo was lower after
                  the second fire than after the first. This trend was
                  observed several years after burning, but not
                  immediately following fire. Green biomass after the
                  second fire significantly increased with longer
                  intervals of time between fires. There was also a
                  positive correlation between postfire NDVI and mean
                  rainfall, whereas a negative correlation was found
                  between NDVI and solar radiation. Forests dominated
                  by resprouting Quercus spp. were more resilient to
                  fire, but they showed a larger decrease in
                  resilience after the second fire than did forests
                  dominated by Pinus spp. that regenerate from
                  seed. We conclude that the use of time series
                  satellite images may help to gain further insights
                  in postfire vegetation dynamics over large regions
                  and long time periods.},

                  Ridge State Park, Sonoma County, CA, were burned for
                  three consecutive years (1993-1995 [Site A] and
                  1995-1997 [Site B]) for control of yellow
                  starthistle. Burns were conducted in late June to
                  early July following seed dispersal and senescence
                  of desirable grasses and forbs but prior to viable
                  seed production in yellow starthistle. After the
                  first year burn, there was no significant reduction
                  in yellow starthistle cover the following spring and
                  summer. Despite the lack of control, the first year
                  burn reduced the yellow starthistle soil seedbank by
                  74% and the number of seedlings the following spring
                  by 83%. However, total plant diversity and species
                  richness increased dramatically in the burned
                  areas. This was due primarily to an increase in the
                  number of native broadleaf species. A second burn
                  the next summer (1995-1997 site) reduced seedbank,
                  seedling density, and summer vegetative cover the
                  following year by 94, 92, and 85%, respectively,
                  while maintaining significantly higher native plant
                  cover and richness. A third consecutive summer burn
                  decreased yellow starthistle seedbank and seedling
                  density by 96, 98, and 85%, respectively in the
                  1995-1997 burn site. Three consecutive years of
                  burning in the 1993-1995 site reduced yellow
                  starthistle seedbank and seedling density by over
                  99% and summer vegetative cover by 91%. These
                  results indicate that prescribed burning can be an
                  effective tool for the management of yellow
                  starthistle and can have a long-term benefit on
                  native broadleaf diversity and richness.},

  abstract =     {Woody plants in fire-frequented ecosystems commonly
                  resprout from underground organs after
                  fires. Responses to variation in characteristics of
                  fire regimes may be a function of plant
                  physiological status or fire intensity. Although
                  these hypotheses have been explored for trees in
                  southeastern longleaf pine (Pines palustris)
                  savannas, responses of other life forms and stages
                  have not been studied. We examined effects of fire
                  season and frequency, geography, habitat, and
                  underground organ morphology on resprouting of
                  shrubs. In 1994, we located replicated sites, each
                  containing two habitats, upslope savannas and
                  downslope seepages, in Louisiana and Florida. Each
                  site, which contained quadrats located along
                  transects within a 30 X 60 m plot, was burned either
                  during the dormant or growing season and then
                  reburned similarly two years later. Maximum fire
                  temperatures were measured, and densities of shrub
                  stems were censused in quadrats before and after
                  fires. Shrubs collectively resprouted more following
                  dormant than growing-season fires, regardless of
                  habitat or geographic region. After repeated
                  dormant-season fires, collective densities in
                  seepages of both regions and densities of
                  root-crown-bearing shrubs in Florida seepages were
                  greater than those initially and after repeated
                  growing-season fires. Shrub responses were generally
                  unrelated to fire temperatures, supporting the
                  hypothesis that resprouting of shrubs may be more
                  dependent on their physiological status at the time
                  of fires. There was, nonetheless, an inverse
                  relationship between collective and
                  root-crown-bearing shrub densities following
                  repeated fires and maximum fire temperatures in
                  Florida seepages. Anthropogenic dormant-season fires
                  over many decades may have resulted in increases in
                  shrub densities in longleaf pine savannas,
                  especially seepages. Repeated growing-season fires,
                  however, neither increased nor reduced densities of
                  established shrubs. Long-term shifts in
                  characteristics of fire regimes, even in
                  fire-frequented habitats, may produce effects that
                  are not reversible in the short term (<10 yr) by
                  simply reintroducing prescribed fires that resemble
                  those that occurred naturally during the growing
                  season.},

                  host-parasite coevolutionary arms races. Its driving
                  force is the reduction of host lifespan or fecundity
                  that is caused by a parasite. Parasites evolve to
                  optimize host exploitation, while hosts evolve to
                  minimize the 'parasite-induced' loss of fitness
                  (virulence). Research on the evolution of virulence
                  has mostly emphasized the role of parasite evolution
                  in determining virulence. However, host evolution,
                  accelerated by sexual recombination, contributes to
                  the evolution and expression of virulence as
                  well. The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that genetic

                  communities represent a simple and predictable
                  response to the abiotic environment. Biota and the
                  abiotic environment interact, and the environment of
                  an individual certainly includes its neighbors and
                  visitors in the community. The complexity of
                  community assembly calls forth a quest for general
                  principles, yet current results and theories on
                  assembly rules differ widely. Using a grassland
                  microcosm as a model system, we manipulated
                  fertility, disturbance by defoliation,
                  soil/microclimate, and arrival order of species
                  belonging to two groups differing in functional
                  attributes. We analyzed the Outcome of community
                  assembly dynamics in terms of species richness,
                  invasibility, and species composition. The analyses
                  revealed strong environmental control over species
                  richness and invasibility. Species composition was
                  mainly determined by the arrival order of species,
                  indicating that historical contingency may change
                  the outcome of community assembly. The probability
                  for multiple equilibria appeared to increase with
                  productivity and environmental stability. The
                  importance of arrival order offers an explanation of
                  the difficulties in predicting local occurrences of
                  species in the field. In our experiment, variation
                  in fertility and disturbance was controlling
                  colonization with predictable effects on emergent
                  community properties such as species richness. The
                  key mechanism is suggested to be asymmetric
                  competition, and our results show that this
                  mechanism is relatively insensitive to the species
                  through which it works. While our analyses indicate
                  a positive and significant correlation between
                  richness and invasibility, the significance
                  disappears after accounting for the effect of the
                  environment. The importance of arrival order
                  (historical contingency) and environmental control
                  supports the assumption of the unified neutral
                  theory that different species within a trophic level
                  can be considered functionally equivalent when it
                  comes to community assembly. However, our results
                  indicate that variation in asymmetric competition is
                  the key factor determining the richness of the
                  resulting communities, and this is far from
                  neutral.},

                  season fire in late successional prairies. Our
                  objective was to determine if late season fire of
                  varying frequency results in divergent successional
                  patterns in an early successional tallgrass prairie
                  disturbed by grazing and cultivation. Specifically,
                  we evaluated the influence of late-summer fires of
                  varying frequency on community composition and
                  species richness. We collected vegetation and
                  environmental data on two sites burned in the late
                  growing-season at varying frequencies. These
                  communities differed in composition depending
                  primarily on edaphic factors, time since the last
                  burn, and year-to-year variation. We interpret the

                  followed disturbance either from cropping and heavy

                  a fire in 1990 in a mixed species stand 15-20 years
                  old, the estimated number of viable seeds released
                  from canopy-stored seed banks was approximately
                  equal for both species. However, the rate of
                  seedling establishment in the first year was about
                  10 times higher, and seedling suvivorship over the
                  first 5 years was seven times higher, for the
                  non-sprouter. Seedlings of Hakea decurrens and
                  resprouts of Hakea rostrata began to produce seeds
                  within three years of the last fire, while the few
                  surviving seedlings of Hakea rostrata showed no
                  evidence of reproductive maturity after six
                  years. Inter-fire recruitment was recorded for the
                  non-sprouter, Hakea decurrens, in the oldest stand
                  (burned in 1967) between 24 and 28 years since last
                  fire. This was associated with an increased rate of
                  seed release from serotinous fruits due to the onset
                  of high rates of adult plant mortality. High adult
                  mortality and increased seed release correlated with
                  increasing stand age, the occurrence of severe
                  drought, and the likely presence of Phytophthora
                  cinnamomi, a fungal pathogen which damages the root
                  system, reducing water and nutrient uptake. There
                  were no new recruits for the resprouter Hakea
                  rostrata in this stand, but old plants continued to
                  resprout from basal lignotubers and no mortality was
                  observed. While recruitment of strongly serotinous
                  shrub species is commonly described as being
                  restricted to the immediate post-fire period, the
                  present study illustrates that other events (e.g.,
                  senescence, drought, disease) can lead to
                  recruitment of serotinous non-sprouters and may be
                  important in the maintenance of populations during
                  unusually long periods without fire.},

                  seeds from a Eucalyptus woodland in western Victoria
                  were tested by using a glasshouse seed-bank
                  germination experiment. Seedling density, species
                  richness and species composition were compared
                  between replicated treated and control samples. A
                  total of 5922 seedlings, comprising 59 plant
                  species, was recorded from the soil samples over a
                  period of 150 days. While a few species dominated
                  (including Centrolepis strigosa, Wahlenbergia
                  gracilenta and Ixodia achillaeoides), 26 species
                  were represented by fewer than five seedlings and 18
                  species were restricted to single treatment
                  types. With the exception of charred wood, all
                  treatments led to a significant increase in seed
                  germination relative to the control. The highest
                  number of germinants was obtained for the smoke
                  treatment, with a mean (+/- SE) of 12 547 +/- 449
                  seedlings m(-2). Heat treatments yielded
                  intermediate densities, with means (+/- SE) varying
                  between 7445 +/- 234 and 9133 +/- 445 seedlings
                  m(-2). In comparison with the estimates of seed-bank
                  sizes from other fire-prone ecosystems, these
                  densities are high. Species richness differed
                  significantly among treatments. Highest mean
                  richness was recorded in the smoke treatment and
                  lowest for the control and charred wood
                  treatments. There were significant differences in
                  seed-bank species composition between treatment
                  types based on analysis of similarity (Anosim) using
                  Bray-Curtis similarity. While heat was a specific
                  requirement for triggering germination in
                  hard-seeded species (e.g. Fabaceae), smoke was the
                  most effective trigger for species from a broad
                  range of other families. The potentially confounding
                  effect of physical and chemical mechanisms of
                  germination stimulation in heated bulk soil samples
                  is raised as an issue requiring further
                  investigation in relation to the role of smoke as a
                  germination trigger.},

                  plants growing in fire-prone environments. However,
                  seed size and other features related to seed
                  production have not been studied in the light of the
                  evolutionary role of fire. Our research tests the
                  hypothesis that larger seeds have a higher chance of
                  surviving wildfires and produce more vigorous
                  seedlings with a lower death rate. To test this
                  hypothesis the germination and early seedling growth
                  of five Spanish pine species were studied. Weight,
                  length and width of all seeds were measured. The
                  biomass (fresh and dry weight) and length (root and
                  total) of subsequent seedlings were also measured
                  after 30 d from emergence. Seeds were submitted to
                  elevated temperatures for periods in which the
                  chance of survival was 50 % (calculated by means of
                  a logistic model for each pine species). The
                  differences observed among species suggests that
                  fire may be adaptively shaping seed size in pines
                  with larger seeds (Pinus canariensis and
                  P. pinaster), because larger seeds are more likely
                  to survive after heat shocks. Furthermore, in
                  P. canariensis, seedlings after heat treatment are
                  even larger than those submitted to control. In
                  P. halepensis, despite being well adapted to fire,
                  our results indicated no relationships between fire
                  and seed characteristics. Finally, although heat
                  treatment has a general adverse effect on seedling
                  growth in the case of the two subalpine pines, we
                  have detected a positive relationship between seed
                  size and seedling growth but only in the largest
                  seeds. This might also suggest the relevance of fire
                  as a selective force for these pines which is
                  outperformed by the relevance of dispersal and
                  emergence time as adaptive traits in the post-fire
                  scenario. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et

                  immigration. Simulations and a mean-field
                  approximation have been used to study this neutral
                  theory. As simulations have limitations of
                  convergence and the mean-field approximation ignores
                  dependencies between species' abundances when
                  applied to species-abundance data, there is still no
                  final conclusion whether the neutral theory or the
                  traditional lognormal model describes community
                  structure best. We present a novel analytical
                  framework, based on the genealogy of individuals in

                  which is the more vulnerable component, the living
                  leaves (symplast) or the non-living water transport
                  system (apoplast). We hypothesized that where
                  Ceanothus species co-occurred, the more inland
                  species C. crassifolius would be more tolerant of
                  low temperatures than the coastal species
                  C. spinosus, both in terms of leaf survival (LT50,
                  or the temperature at which there is 50% loss of
                  function or viability) and in terms of resistance to
                  freezing-induced embolism (measurements of percent
                  loss hydraulic conductivity due to embolism
                  following freeze/thaw). Cooling experiments on 2 m
                  long winter-acclimated shoots resulted in LT50
                  values of about -10degreesC for C. spinosus versus
                  -18degreesC for C. crassifolius. Freeze-thaw cycles
                  resulted in no change in embolism when the plants
                  were well hydrated (-0.7 to -2.0 MPa). However, when
                  plants were dehydrated to -5.0 MPa, C. spinosus
                  became 96% embolized with freeze/thaw, versus only
                  61% embolism for C. crassifolius. Stems of
                  C. crassifolius became 90% and 97% embolized at -6.6
                  and -8.0 MPa, respectively, meaning that even in
                  this species, stems could be more vulnerable than
                  leaves under conditions of extreme water stress
                  combined with freeze/thaw events. The dominance of
                  C. crassifolius at colder sites and the restriction
                  of C. spinosus to warmer sites are consistent with
                  both the relative tolerance of their symplasts to
                  low temperatures and the relative tolerance of their
                  apoplasts to freeze events in combination with

                  recombination at modifier loci. Modifier models
                  demonstrate, however, that equilibrium mean fitness
                  can decrease during the evolution of recombination
                  rates and is not always maximized. Therefore,

                  models indicate that decreased recombination rates

                  near a polymorphic equilibrium with linkage

                  directional selection or to deleterious mutations,

                  a Mediterranean-basin mountain matorral species,
                  shows a wide range of possibilities and variations
                  in sexual and asexual regeneration. Its
                  interpretation requires basic information on the
                  below-ground structure of parent plants as well as
                  on the origin and development of seedlings and
                  various ramet (sprout clump) types: rootstock,
                  basal-branch, and lateral-root ramets. Morphology
                  and emergence of such ramets in C. oromediterraneus
                  is similar to that in related species but with some
                  specific features described here in detail. In order
                  to determine if characteristics of 1-year-old
                  populations depended on the age of the burned parent
                  plants, two populations were investigated: (A
                  7-year-old, and B 14-year-old). In the most frequent
                  populations in our study area, i.e. those from
                  parent populations of ca. 7 years (A): a-plant
                  density and biomass were highly variable and
                  positively correlated; b-frequency distribution
                  differed significantly from normal distribution for
                  plant weight, but not for other parameters such as
                  diameters, perimeter, and height, in which it did,
                  however, show asymmetry; c-perimeter was the best
                  parameter for estimating individuals' weight;
                  d-there was a higher number of seedlings than ramets
                  but their biomass was smaller; e-the size of
                  seedlings and ramets showed wide variation. In
                  comparison with population A (7-year-old) population
                  B (14-year-old) showed: significantly higher
                  density, slightly lower biomass, higher number of
                  small individuals, mainly seedlings, and less
                  vigorous resprouting. In general, 1 year after fire,
                  Cytisus oromeditarraneus population density mainly
                  depends on the germination response, while the
                  above-ground biomass mainly depends on the
                  vegetative response and the intensity of both of
                  them is conditioned by parent plant age. (C) 2004

                  the soil seed bank and its consequences on the early
                  stages of post-disturbance succession-were
                  analyzed. The hypothesis that low-intensity fire may
                  produce a population decline of hard-seeded species
                  by the elimination of established plants and the
                  lack of a seed germination promotion effect was
                  investigated. Consecutive pre- and post-burning soil
                  samplings revealed extremely low impact of fire on
                  seed banks. In contrast, some specific seed banks
                  increased with fire, probably due to a seed rain
                  from fire-opening of capsule fruits. Fire neither
                  promoted germination of hard-coated seeds nor
                  affected their viability. Both the length of the
                  seed-unproductive juvenile phase and post-fire
                  habitat conditions were revealed as critical in
                  determining the recovery of hard-seeded species
                  after a low-intensity fire. Species with a short
                  life cycle produced seeds in the year subsequent to
                  the disturbance, ensuring a progressive moderate
                  recovery from the few individuals which emerged
                  after fire. This was particularly true in the
                  southern exposure, where other seed-softening
                  factors not exclusively related to fire may operate
                  in a more intense way, compensating the null effect
                  on germination of the low-fire intensity. For Cistus
                  clusii, with a relatively long juvenile-phase span
                  (3 years), low post-fire germination coincided with
                  a long seed-unproductive period, which finally
                  overlapped with a dramatic seed bank viability
                  depletion (63-68%). In the northern exposure, fire
                  resulted in a complete extinction of this species.},

                  fire regime treatments resulted in simulation of
                  fire cycles within 7% of these intended values when
                  fire cycles were averaged across ten replicated
                  model runs per treatment. Within individual 500-year
                  model runs, the error in the simulated fire cycle
                  (average area burned per decade) reached 11% for the
                  moderate and frequent fire cycle treatments and 53%
                  for infrequent. The infrequent fire regime resulted
                  in an old landscape dominated by the three most
                  shade tolerant and long-lived functional groups,
                  while shorter-lived and less shade tolerant seeders
                  and resprouters disappeared from the landscape. The
                  moderate fire regime, similar to what is considered
                  the current fire regime in the southern California
                  foothills, resulted in a younger landscape where the
                  facultative resprouter persisted along with the
                  long-lived shade tolerant functional groups, but the
                  obligate seeder with low fire tolerance disappeared,
                  despite its moderate shade tolerance, The frequent
                  fire regime resulted in the persistence of all
                  functional groups on the landscape with more even
                  cover, but the same rank order as under the moderate
                  regime. The model, originally developed for northern
                  temperate forests, appears to be useful for
                  simulating the disturbance regime in this fire-prone
                  Mediterranean-type ecosystem. (C) 2001 Elsevier

                  followed by the return of fire. Regeneration was
                  dense and highlyaggregated at all sites but the
                  frequent-fire overstory was random to uniform in
                  spatial distribution and relatively open while the
                  fire-excluded sites hadclumped overstory trees with
                  a high density of smaller trees. Dominance by

                  sites, consistent both with thinning by fire and
                  density-dependent mortality, but competitive
                  self-thinning appeared insufficient to counteractthe
                  increased tree density without fire. The return of
                  fire after 29 years of exclusion reduced tree
                  density but left overstory trees aggregated and led
                  to vigorousoak and alder sprouting. Frequent fire
                  disturbance is considered essential to maintain open
                  pine forests; fire exclusion with or without
                  subsequent fire appearsto lead to denser forests

                  years and show no signs of senescence, while others
                  consistently die after finite life spans. Using two
                  models, we examined how stage-specific life-history
                  rates of a clone's modules determine whether a
                  genetic individual escapes senescence by replacing
                  old modules with new ones. When the rates of clonal
                  or sexual reproduction and survival of individual
                  modules decline with age, clones are more likely to
                  experience senescence. In addition, the models
                  predict that there is a greater tendency to find
                  senescence in terms of a decline in the rate of
                  sexual reproduction with clone age than in terms of
                  an increase in the probability of clone mortality,
                  unless rates of sexual reproduction increase
                  dramatically with module stage. Using a matrix model
                  modified to represent the clonal lifestyle, we show
                  how a trade-off between sexual and clonal
                  reproduction could result in selection for or
                  against clonal senescence. We also show that, in
                  contrast to unitary organisms, the strength of
                  selection on life-history traits can increase with
                  the age of a clone even in a growing population,
                  countering the evolution of senescence.},

  abstract =     {Interspecific comparisons have played a prominent
                  role in evolutionary biology at least since the time
                  of Charles Darwin. Since 1985, the ''comparative
                  method'' has been revitalized by new analytical
                  techniques that use phylogenetic information and by
                  increased availability of phylogenies (often from
                  molecular data sets), Because species descend from
                  common ancestors in a hierarchical fashion, related
                  species tend to resemble each other (elephants look
                  like elephants); therefore, cross-species data sets
                  generally do not comprise Independent and
                  identically distributed data points,
                  Phylogenetically based statistical methods attempt
                  to account for this fact, Phylogenetic methods allow
                  traditional topics in comparative and ecological
                  physiology to be addressed with greater rigor,
                  including the form of allometric relationships and
                  whether physiological phenotypes vary predictably in
                  relation to behavior, ecology or environmental
                  characteristics, which provides evidence about
                  adaptation, They can also address new topics, such
                  as whether rates of physiological evolution have
                  differed among lineages (clades), and where and when
                  a phenotype first evolved, We present brief
                  overviews of three phylogenetically based
                  statistical methods: phylogenetically independent
                  contrasts, Monte Carlo computer simulations to
                  obtain null distributions of test statistics, and
                  phylogenetic autocorrelation, In a new result, we
                  show analytically how to use independent contrasts
                  to estimate ancestral values and confidence
                  intervals about them, These confidence intervals
                  often exceed the range of variation observed among
                  extant species, which points out the relatively
                  great uncertainty inherent in such inferences, The
                  use of phylogenies should become as common as the
                  use of body size and scaling relationships in the
                  analysis of physiological diversity.},

                  of a long-lived perennial tussock grass, Hyparrhenia
                  diplandra, were investigated in a West African
                  savanna that normally burns annually. Seedling
                  growth, survival and fecundity were recorded in
                  burned and unburned plots during 3 years for a first
                  cohort and during 1 year for a second cohort
                  initiated 1 year later. 2 Seedling growth and
                  survival rates were significantly higher in unburned
                  plots, with larger seedlings surviving burning
                  better. Regardless of treatment/fire regime,
                  seedlings grew faster when located further from the
                  nearest tuft, but differences between clones showed
                  that growth rate also had a genetic basis in this
                  apomictic species. Adult survival was always high,
                  but exclusion of fire increased size, and therefore
                  age, at maturity. Fire therefore affects
                  life-history traits in this grass species of
                  fire-prone environments. 3 Size-structured matrix
                  models were constructed separately for each fire
                  treatment, incorporating demographic and fire
                  parameters estimated from field data. 4 The
                  asymptotic population growth rate was higher in the
                  unburned model (lambda = 1.23) than in the burned
                  one (lambda = 1.07), indicating that the population
                  of H. diplandra expanded quickly in the absence of
                  fire. 5 Overall, results indicate that annual
                  burning limits population growth rate. Less
                  frequent, but still regular fires may allow
                  establishment while preventing the accumulation of
                  litter and accelerating nutrient recycling; thus
                  lead to more stable populations than in the total
                  absence of fire.},

                  awn whose length varies within and among plants. In
                  other grass species awns play a significant role in
                  secondary dispersal on the ground and in seed
                  burial. Using an ex perimental approach, we
                  quantified (1) the environmental and genetic
                  components of awn length variation, (2) the
                  influence of awn length variation on seed burial
                  depth, (3) the effect of awn length on seed
                  germination and seedling survival rates in burned
                  and unburned plots, and (4) the potential role of
                  fire intensity in selecting diaspores with different
                  awn lengths. Awn length varied from 35 to 70 mm and
                  was highly heritable (H(2) = 0.63). },

                  stochastic force induced by substitutions at one
                  locus on the dynamics of a closely linked locus. Of
                  particular interest is the role of population size
                  on genetic draft. Remarkably, the rate of
                  substitution of weakly selected advantageous
                  mutations decreases with increasing population size,
                  whereas that for deleterious mutations increases
                  with population size. This dependency on population
                  size is the opposite of that for genetic
                  drift. Moreover, these rates are only weakly
                  dependent on population size, again contrary to the
                  strong dependency of drift-based dynamics, Four
                  models of the strongly selected loci responsible for
                  genetic draft are examined, Three of these exhibit a
                  very weak dependency on population size, which
                  implies that their induced effects will also be
                  weakly dependent on population size. Together, these
                  results suggest that population size and binomial
                  sampling may not be relevant to a species'

  abstract =     {Tests of adaptive explanations are often critically
                  confounded by phylogenetic heritage. In this paper
                  we propose statistics and a null model for
                  estimating phylogenetic effects in comparative
                  data. We apply a model-independent measure of
                  autocorrelation (Moran's I) for estimating whether
                  cross-taxonomic trait variation is related to
                  phylogeny. We develop a phylogenetic correlogram for
                  assessing how autocorrelation varies with patristic
                  distance and for judging the appropriateness and
                  effectiveness of an autoregressive model. We then
                  revise Cheverud et al.'s (1985, Evolution,
                  39:1335-1351) autocorrelational model to incorporate
                  greater flexibility in the relation between trait
                  variation and phylogenetic distance. Finally, we
                  analyze various comparative data sets (body weight
                  incarnivores, clutch size in birds) and phylogenies
                  (morphological, molecular) to illustrate some of the
                  complications that may arise from using an
                  autoregressive model and to explore the effects of
                  different weighting matrices in adjusting for these
                  complications. Although our approach has
                  limitations, it is both effective in partitioning
                  trait variation into adaptive and phylogenetic
                  components and flexible in adjusting to
                  perculiarities in taxonomic distribution.},

                  component of the natural disturbance regime of
                  presettlement savannas and woodlands in the
                  southeastern USAdominated by longleaf pine (Pinus
                  palustris), and prescribed burning is now a critical
                  part of the management of these endangered
                  habitats. Fire season,fire frequency, and fire
                  intensity are three potentially important, though
                  still little understood, components of both natural
                  and managed fire regimes. In thislong-term (8-yr)
                  study, we experimentally (through the use of
                  prescribed burning) tested for effects of fire
                  season (eight different times throughout the
                  year)and fire frequency (annual vs. biennial
                  burning), on population dynamics (recruitment,
                  growth, mortality, change in density, and change in
                  basal area [the totalbasal area of all stems in a
                  plot]) and species composition of trees in two quite
                  different types of longleaf-pine-dominated habitats
                  (north Florida sandhills andflatwoods). Limited fire
                  temperature and intensity data were also collected
                  during one year to examine the relationship between
                  fire behavior (temperature andintensity) and tree
                  mortality. Contrary to prior hypotheses, our results
                  showed few systematic or predictable effects of
                  season or frequency of burning ondynamics of
                  longleaf pine. Instead, variability in the
                  population dynamics of this species appeared to be
                  related largely to variation in fire behavior,
                  regardlessof the season of burning. Consistent with
                  prior hypotheses, we found that deciduous oak
                  species (Quercus laevis, e. margaretta, and
                  Q. incana) were leastvulnerable to dormant-season
                  burning and most vulnerable to burning early in the
                  growing season. This was shown particularly by
                  seasonal trends in the effectof burning on oak
                  mortality (both topkill and complete kill) and, to a
                  lesser extent, on oak recruitment. Oak densities and
                  basal areas also declined in thespring-burned plots,
                  resulting in a shift away from oaks and towards
                  increased dominance by longleaf pine. Detrimental
                  effects of spring burning on oaks werepartly
                  explained by fire behavior, but there appeared also
                  to be an important residual effect of burning
                  season, particularly on complete kill. Though
                  longleafpine population dynamics did not differ
                  markedly as a result of burning season and
                  frequency, we did find important differences in pine
                  dynamics between thetwo habitats (i.e., sandhills
                  and flatwoods). In general, populations of longleaf
                  pines in the sandhills appeared to be density
                  regulated, while flatwoods pinepopulations were
                  declining regardless of the level of intraspecific
                  competition. This suggests that long-term
                  persistence of longleaf pine, and perhaps
                  otherfire-adapted species in frequently burned

  abstract =     {We examine the effects of density dependence and
                  immigration on local adaptation in a ''black-hole
                  sink'' habitat, i.e., a habitat in which isolated
                  populations of a species would tend to extinction
                  but where a population is demographically maintained
                  by recurrent one-way migration from a separate
                  source habitat in which the species persists. Using
                  a diploid, one-locus model of a discrete-generation
                  sink population maintained by immigration from a
                  fixed source population, we show that a locally
                  favored allele will spread when rare in the sink if
                  the absolute fitness (or, in some cases, the
                  geometric-mean absolute fitness) of heterozygotes
                  with the favored allele is above one in the sink
                  habitat. With density dependence, the criterion for
                  spread can depend on the rate of immigration,
                  because immigration affects local densities and,
                  hence, absolute fitness. Given the successful
                  establishment of a locally favored allele, it will
                  be maintained by a migration-selection balance and
                  the resulting polymorphic population will be
                  sustained deterministically with either stable or
                  unstable dynamics. The densities of stable
                  polymorphic populations tend to exceed densities
                  that would be maintained in the absence of the
                  favored allele. With strong density regulation,
                  spread of the favored allele may destabilize
                  population dynamics. Our analyses show that
                  polymorphic populations which form subsequent to the
                  establishment of favorable alleles have the capacity
                  to persist deterministically without
                  immigration. Finally, we examined the probabilistic
                  rate at which new favored alleles arise and become
                  established in a sink population. Our results
                  suggest that favored alleles are established most
                  readily at intermediate levels of immigration, (C)

                  geographic mosaics of populations shaped by
                  differences in local selection and gene flow. We use
                  a haploid matching-alleles model for coevolution to
                  evaluate how a pair of species coevolves when
                  fitness interactions are reciprocal in some
                  locations (''hot spots'') but not in others (''cold
                  spots''). Our analyses consider mutualistic and
                  antagonistic interspecific interactions and a
                  variety of gene Dow patterns between hot and cold
                  spots. We found that hot and cold spots together
                  with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in
                  four important ways. First, hot spots need not be
                  ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution,
                  although rare hat spots wilt not have a
                  disproportionate impact unless selection is
                  relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries in gene
                  flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes
                  creating stable equilibria at which species
                  experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal
                  fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third,
                  asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than
                  asymmetries in population regulation for determining
                  the maintenance of local polymorphisms through
                  coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency
                  differences among hot and cold spot populations
                  evolve under some, but not all, conditions. That is,
                  selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing
                  spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across
                  the landscapes over which species
                  interact. Altogether, our analyses indicate that
                  coevolutionary trajectories can be strongly shaped
                  by the geographic distribution of coevolutionary hot
                  and cold spots, and by the pattern of gene flow
                  among populations.},

                  P. sylvestris. On the whole, our results demonstrate
                  that sufficient genetic variation exists in
                  P. sylvestris to explain its great ecological
                  plasticity and evolutionary potential. Estimated
                  parameters of gene diversity, genetic distance and
                  gene flow show that the P. sylvestris populations we
                  studied share a common gene pool.},

                  were investigated by starch-gel electrophoresis. In
                  the populations assayed 127 allelic variants at 25
                  loci were revealed. NEI's distance coefficient (Dn)
                  was used to estimate the level of genetic
                  differentiation among P. sylvestris races and among
                  closely related species. A dendrogram constructed
                  using Dn values shows that of the five P. sylvestris
                  races analyzed only the geographically isolated
                  var. hamata exhibited sufficient differences at the
                  Dia-2 locus (a mean Dn value relative to the other
                  four races is 0.025) to recognize it as a distinct
                  taxon. The remaining races, "sylvestris",
                  "cretacea", "lapponica", and "sibirica", have a
                  similar gene pool (Dn values are not greater than
                  0.010), and they should be regarded as a single
                  taxon, P. sylvestris var. sylvestris. Interspecific
                  comparisons revealed that P. sylvestris and P. mugo
                  have the closest genetic affinities to each other
                  with NEI'S genetic distance of 0. 108. The
                  dendrogram demonstrates that P. funebris is closer
                  to P. sylvestris and P. mugo than P. pallasiana. The
                  available paleontologic data allowed us to conclude

                  (Eucalyptus marginata) forest using the techniques
                  of ordination (CANOCO (TM)) and classification
                  (TWINSPAN (TM)). Analyses of understorey species
                  density and cover values showed consistent patterns
                  of composition and abundance between the native
                  jar;ah forest and the rehabilitated areas, both
                  before and after burning. These patterns resulted
                  from the intentional establishment of high densities
                  of legume species in the initial rehabilitation
                  process and proliferation of high densities of
                  seeding species and non-native eucalypt seedlings
                  following burning of the rehabilitated areas,
                  features not characteristic of native jarrah
                  forest. Burnt sites showed larger changes in species
                  abundance and composition than unburnt control sites
                  as indicated by their relative shift of position in
                  the ordination hyper-space. This shift in position
                  was generally less for sites burnt in spring than
                  sites burnt in autumn. The first two divisions of
                  the site classifications separated the unburnt sites
                  and early spring post-burn sites from the forest and
                  the remainder of the post-burn sites. The species
                  classification showed that each of these groups was
                  associated with a specific suite of species. Pit age
                  (i.e. 11, 12 or 13 years-old at time of burning) was
                  an important determinant of species composition in
                  both the ordinations and classifications. Although
                  species densities recovered more rapidly than live
                  plant cover in the rehabilitated areas following
                  burning, the vegetation of these rehabilitated sites
                  exhibited little evidence of returning to their
                  pre-tire species composition and abundance after 2
                  years. However, the high species similarity (75-79%)
                  between the pre-burn (including species only present
                  as sled in the topsoil) and post-bum vegetation
                  indicates the importance of the initial floristic
                  composition in determining the potential direction
                  of the post-fire succession. (C) 2001 Elsevier

                  to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in northern
                  Arizona. The treatments represented the full range
                  of existing stand disturbance conditions and
                  included forest stands that were unmanaged, thinned,
                  thinned and prescribed burned, and burned by
                  stand-replacing wildfire in order of increasing
                  disturbance intensity. We assessed differences in
                  understory diversity associated with these
                  treatments. We identified 195 species of understory
                  plants. focusing on the distribution of natives and
                  exotics. The abundance of understory plants was more
                  sensitive to changes in management treatments than
                  the overall species richness. Exotics on the whole,
                  responded statistically more strongly to disturbance
                  treatments than did natives. Both the richness and
                  abundance of exotic forbs increased significantly
                  with treatment intensity. Species richness remained
                  stable while abundance of native graminoids
                  increased significantly with treatment intensity
                  through thinned and burned stands. Both then
                  decreased significantly in stands that experienced
                  wildfire. The number of native shrub species
                  decreased significantly with treatment
                  intensity. Overall plant diversity was least in the
                  unmanaged stands and progressively increased with
                  intensity of disturbance/stand treatments. Both
                  prescribed burning and wildfire increased plant
                  diversity; however, stand-replacing wildfire also
                  appeared to substantially increase the diversity of
                  exotic plants. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

                  examined the influence of wild-fire ash residues on
                  soil, microbial and plant N pools in a recently
                  burned Californian bishop pine (Pinus muricata
                  D. Don) forest. Ash stimulated post-fire primary
                  production and ecosystem N retention through direct
                  N inputs from ash to soils, as well as indirect ash
                  effects on soil N availability to plants. These
                  results suggest that redistribution of surface ash
                  after fire by wind or water may cause substantial
                  heterogeneity in soil N availability to plants? and
                  could be an important mechanism contributing to
                  vegetation patchiness in fire-prone ecosystems. In
                  addition, we investigated the impact of fire on
                  ecosystem N cycling by comparing N-15 natural
                  abundance values from recently burned and nearby
                  unburned P. muricata forest communities. At the
                  burned site, N-15 natural abundance in recolonising
                  species was similar to that in bulk soil organic
                  matter. By contrast, there was a marked N-15
                  depletion in the same species relative to the total
                  soil N pool at the unburned site. These results
                  suggest that plant uptake of nitrate (which tends to
                  be strongly depleted in N-15 because of
                  fractionation during nitrification) is low in
                  recently burned forest communities but could be an
                  important component of ecosystem N cycling in mature
                  conifer stands.},

                  focusing on plants. The marked effects on organisms
                  are of increasing interest for ecological
                  prediction, given the natural and anthropogenic
                  changes in spectra of extreme events being induced

                  of knowledge or even a common world-view of how
                  extreme events shape individuals, communities and We

                  extreme events occur primarily during recovery. We
                  review evidence that, on the evolutionary time
                  scale, selection is, virtually absent except during
                  extreme events; these drive strong directional
                  selection, even to trait fixation and speciation. We

                  allowing for coexistence of infinitely many
                  strategies is structurally unstable. In particular,
                  this is the case when the "interaction operator"
                  which determines how the growth rate of a strategy
                  depends on the strategy distribution of the
                  population is compact. The interaction operator is
                  not assumed to be linear. We investigate a
                  Lotka-Volterra competition model with a linear
                  interaction operator of convolution type separately
                  because the convolution operator is not compact. For

                  even on a set containing a limit point. Moreover, we

                  populations it is possible to have robust
                  coexistence in this case. These results are in line
                  with the ecological concept of "limiting similarity"

  abstract =     {If constantly changing genotypes are favorable in
                  host and parasite coevolution, an indefinite
                  escalation of mutation rates would result despite
                  heavy mutational loads. We theoretically study this
                  possibility by examining the mutation modifier
                  dynamics of host and parasite that engage in
                  genotype-specific epidemiological interaction. In
                  the first model, we study the evolutionarily stable
                  (ESS) mutation rate or switching rate if two alleles
                  in a single locus are subjected to
                  frequency-dependent selection favoring the rarer of
                  the two. Mutation modifier locus is either tightly
                  linked or unlinked to the selected
                  locus. Sufficiently strong frequency-dependent
                  selection may cause cycles in allele frequencies,
                  and a modifier with higher mutation rate enjoys the
                  long-term advantage by randomizing the genotype of
                  their offspring. Through the repeated events of
                  invasion and replacement of mutation modifiers, the
                  mutation rate continues to increase until the allele
                  frequencies are stabilized. If some fraction of
                  mutations are deleterious, there is no longer a pure
                  ESS mutation rate: the evolutionarily stable
                  population then consists of multiple strains
                  concerning mutation modifier, typically one with a
                  very high mutation rate and the other with a very
                  low rate, stably coexisting and fighting off
                  invasions by any other modifiers. These results are
                  almost independent of the linkage between the
                  selected and the modifier loci. In the second model,
                  we consider the joint evolution of host and parasite
                  mutation modifiers, assuming that a specific pair of
                  host and parasite genotype densities change
                  following the Nicholson-Bailey type model. If there
                  is no cost of deleterious mutations, mutation rates
                  of both species are escalated indefinitely by
                  modifier evolution until they completely suppress
                  the fluctuation of genotype densities. However, a
                  small cost of deleterious mutation is enough to
                  collapse this coevolutionary equilibrium of inflated
                  mutations. Typical coevolutionary outcome is that
                  the parasite mutation rate is accelerated to a high
                  level; whereas the host mutation rate is driven to
                  zero. Extension of our results to host-parasite
                  coevolution of recombination modifier evolution is
                  discussed. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited},

                  natural history of Ceanothus have served as a
                  general model of evolution for woody perennials with
                  simple entomophilous pollination systems, but these
                  interpretations lacked explicit phylogenetic
                  context. We used cladistic analysis of sequences of
                  the chloroplast-encoded matK and the internal
                  transcribed spacers (ITS) and 5.85 coding region of
                  nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) to reconstruct the
                  phylogeny of Ceanothus. The nuclear and organellar
                  phylogenies exhibited very low levels of both
                  topological and character conference. Subgenera
                  Ceanothus and Cerastes are monophyletic sister taxa
                  in both phylogenies, but both data sets suffer from
                  a lack of resolution below the level of
                  subgenus. Lack of taxonomic congruence between the
                  two data sets may be a result of introgression
                  and/or lineage sorting. The ITS tree was accepted as
                  the better estimate of a species phylogeny for
                  Ceanothus, on the assumption that nuclear markers
                  are less prone to introgression. Three of five
                  polytypic species in the ITS data set were
                  paraphyletic, and four of six polytypic species in
                  the matK data set were paraphyletic. This study
                  demonstrates the degree to which matched independent

                  to plant parasitic fungi is the result of
                  parasite-non-specific basic resistance rather than
                  the consequence of specific recognition of each
                  fungal parasite. In crop plants, and probably wild
                  plant species, this basic resistance in maintained
                  by a mixture of passive and active defenses that
                  exhibit inter-, and possibly intra-, specific
                  differences. Many, if not all, of the components of
                  basic resistance not only defend the plant against
                  stresses in addition to those exerted by plant
                  parasitic fungi, but also have other roles in plant
                  structure and function. Therefore, these components
                  may be subject to random effects and multiple
                  selection pressures of which fungal parasitism may
                  be a minor component. Nevertheless, the coupling of
                  the recognition of fungal products or activities
                  with the inducible components of basic resistance
                  seems to have occurred early in plant evolution,
                  although not necessarily in response to selective
                  pressures exerted by ancient fungi. It is suggested
                  that in natural ecosystems, parasite-specific
                  resistance should have no selective advantage until
                  the fungus has established sufficient basic
                  compatibility (by means of specific pathogenicity
                  factors) with its host species that the plant's
                  fitness is reduced. This resistance may not
                  necessarily be the result of 'gene-for-gene'
                  interactions, and may be difficult to distinguish
                  from pathovar-specific, 'residual' basic resistance
                  resulting from fungal genotypes differing in their
                  complement of pathogenicity factors such that each
                  one is able to completely overcome the basic
                  resistance of only some genotypes of the
                  host. Superimposed on any co-evolutionary changes in
                  plant and fungus are longer-term changes in basic
                  resistance that may eventually change a susceptible
                  host into a non-host if the fungus cannot produce
                  the necessary new or modified pathogenicity
                  factors. Major determinants of the evolutionary
                  paths followed by any interacting plant and fungus
                  are the actual mechanisms of plant resistance and
                  fungal pathogenicity or virulence. Therefore, the
                  complex web of interactions that exists today
                  reflects the evolutionary path that each organism
                  has followed as well as more recent selective
                  pressures on the interactions themselves.},

                  phosphorus-deficient terra rossa soil overlying
                  limestone were studied over a 10-yr
                  period. Herbicide application and phosphate
                  fertilizer were combined to provide a range of
                  initial conditions for recovery. The site was
                  undisturbed during the growing season in winter but
                  was grazed by cattle in summer. Encroachment rate of
                  S. spinosum was mainly a function of the density of
                  viable buds on plants that survived the fire and/or
                  the shrub control treatments. This, together with
                  the very low rate of shrub establishment from seed
                  set a short-to-medium term limit to the attainable
                  cover of S. spinosum. The leguminous shrub
                  Calycotome villosa appeared only in the third year
                  after the fire, apparently from seed. After shrub
                  control, the encroachment rate of C. villosa was
                  low, even after 9 yr. On the other hand, where no
                  herbicide was applied, and with the cessation of
                  goat grazing, C. villosa became increasingly
                  prominent, to the extent that by the 8th year after
                  the fire, it inhibited the continued expansion of
                  S. spinosum. Phosphorus nutrition tended to reduce
                  the cover of S. spinosum because of its stimulating
                  effect on the predominantly leguminous herbaceous
                  vegetation. C. villosa also appeared to benefit from
                  greater phosphorus availability, despite greater
                  competition from the annual vegetation. These
                  findings show that, depending on the context,
                  secondary succession after fire can take different
                  courses. Whereas the combined effect of herbicide
                  control and P-enrichment cannot prevent shrub
                  encroachment, it can slow down the rate of
                  succession for more than a decade, despite the
                  presence of ample shrub seed sources in the area.},

                  shrub species in a temperate woodland of semi-arid
                  Australia was investigated and related to population
                  survival strategies. Straw was added to 21 x 15 m
                  plots in the woodland, burnt and the pre-fire
                  characteristics of shrubs were used to determine the
                  basis for sprouting success. Species differed widely
                  (4-94%) in sprouting success; a high percentage of
                  established seedlings of all species were killed by
                  lire but survival increased with height reaching a
                  maximum at 25-60 cm (depending on the
                  species). Thickness of bark at stem bases increased
                  with height growth but sprouting success was not
                  related to bark thickness; sprouting success of
                  shrubs at similar thickness varied greatly between
                  species. All species were able to initiate sprouts
                  after cutting through their basal stems, so lack of
                  active meristems was not a limitation. Species
                  differed in the height at which shrubs began
                  flowering but this was always after maximum
                  sprouting success was reached. It is proposed that
                  differences between individual shrubs in supply of
                  nutrients, carbohydrates, and/or water to activated
                  meristems would account for patterns of inter- and
                  intra-specific sprouting success. The data are
                  consistent with recognised fin survival
                  strategies. 'Sprouters', the species relying more on
                  sprouting than recruitment for population
                  persistence, maintained maximum sprouting success
                  with height growth and gained sprouting ability
                  along stems once they reached Im in height. In
                  contrast, 'non-sprouters', the species largely
                  relying on recruitment from seed to maintain
                  populations, were either not able to sprout after
                  seedling establishment or steadily lost the ability
                  to maintain sprouts with growth beyond 60 cm and did
                  not develop axillary buds along stems at any
                  height.},

                  adopting an approach in which an understanding of
                  community and ecosystem dynamics is applied to
                  restoration practices, protocols can be developed
                  which will lead to more efficient restoration. This
                  understanding is based on a review of the relevant
                  ecological literature, focusing on recruitment
                  dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem
                  function, which are particularly relevant to
                  restoration. We develop a conceptual framework for
                  restoration and apply our protocols to a case study
                  area on the Cape Peninsula. Before ecological
                  restoration can begin, the cause of transformation
                  must first be removed or ameliorated. The next step
                  is to ensure that the important ecological processes
                  are functioning. We contend that a fully functioning
                  community requires a good balance of the major
                  growth-form, regeneration, and nutrient acquisition
                  guilds. Fire is the natural disturbance event
                  initiating recruitment in fynbos. It is, therefore,
                  essential to either bunt a site or provide
                  fire-related germination cues in order to stimulate
                  recruitment. Where guilds are under-represented,
                  corrective reintroductions will further improve the
                  long-term resilience of the restored community. Many
                  taxa have persistent soil-stored seed banks, so it
                  is important to conserve topsoil and optimize use of
                  this local species pool. Seed dispersal distances
                  are generally very short, and in highly transformed
                  sites it will be necessary to reintroduce seed of
                  the major guilds in order to restore community
                  structure and functioning. Post-fire succession in
                  fynbos begins with the full complement of species;
                  species gradually die out from the vegetation
                  according to their respective life spans. In order
                  to stimulate germination and promote successful
                  establishment, it is important to sow seed after
                  fire or site clearing in late summer or
                  autumn. Introducing seed or plants at a later stage
                  in the succession is very likely to fail. Because of
                  the localized distributions of many taxa, extreme
                  care must be taken when selecting species for
                  reintroduction if local gene pools are to be
                  conserved.},

  abstract =     {The most basic adaptation of a species is its
                  ecological niche - that set of environmental
                  conditions, resources, etc. which permit its
                  populations to persist without
                  immigration. Immigration from habitats with
                  conditions within the niche (''source'' populations)
                  can sustain populations in habitats outside the
                  niche (''sink'' populations). Recent theoretical
                  work on adaptive evolution in source-sink
                  environments suggests that niche evolution should
                  often be conservative, favoring the improvement or
                  maintenance of adaptation to sources, at the expense
                  of improved adaptation in sinks. Niche conservatism
                  requires sinks to remain sinks over evolutionary
                  time-scales. This paper uses models of coupled
                  population and evolutionary dynamics in a spatially
                  heterogeneous environment to examine the effect of
                  density-dependence on niche conservatism and
                  evolution. Density-dependence in birth, death, or
                  dispersal rates can influence the relative
                  evolutionary importance of source and sink
                  habitats. Three distinct dispersal modes are
                  compared. Species with density-dependent, ideal-free
                  dispersal should exhibit niche conservatism. Species
                  with passive or density-independent dispersal are
                  more likely to show niche evolution, but only if
                  rates of dispersal are sufficiently high and fitness
                  in the sink is not too low. Species with active
                  interference leading to a non-ideal free habitat
                  distribution should be expected to be evolutionarily
                  labile in their ecological niches. I conclude that
                  the nature of density-dependence in dispersal may
                  crucially govern the direction of niche evolution.},

                  population dynamics. Conversely, population dynamics
                  can affect both the rate and direction of adaptive
                  evolution. This paper examines reasons why sink
                  populations - populations maintained by immigration,
                  preventing local extinction - might persist in the
                  habitat repertoire of a species over evolutionary
                  time-scales. Two such reasons correspond to standard
                  explanations for deviations from an ideal free
                  habitat distribution: organisms may not be free to
                  settle in whichever habitat has the highest
                  potential fitness, and may be constrained by costs,
                  perceptual limitations, or mode of dispersal in the
                  acuity of their habitat selectivity. Here, I argue
                  that a third general reason for persistent sink
                  populations is provided by unstable population
                  dynamics in source habitats. I present a simple
                  model illustrating how use of a sink habitat may be
                  selectively advantageous, when a source population
                  has unstable dynamics (which necessarily reflects
                  temporal variation in local fitnesses). Species with
                  unstable local dynamics in high-quality habitats
                  should be selected to utilize a broader range of
                  habitats than species with stable local dynamics,
                  and in particular in some circumstances should
                  utilize sink habitats. This observation has
                  implications for the direction of niche evolution,
                  and the likelihood of niche conservatism.},

                  Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France]
                  that comprise 82% of the chloroplast genome. Up to
                  313 restriction sites were surveyed, and 25 of these
                  were observed to be polymorphic among or within

                  majority of genetic (haplotypic) diversity observed
                  [G(ST) = 84(+/-13)%]; nucleotide diversity among
                  species was, estimated to be 0.3(+/- 0.1)%. Knobcone
                  pine and Monterey pine displayed almost no genetic
                  variation within or among populations. Bishop pine
                  also showed little variability within populations,
                  but did display strong population differences [G(st)

                  geographic groups. Mean nucleotide diversity within
                  populations was 0.003(+/-0.002)%; intrapopulation
                  polymorphisms were found in only five
                  populations. This pattern of genetic variation
                  contrasts strongly with findings from study of
                  nuclear genes (allozymes) in the group, where most
                  genetic diversity resides within populations rather
                  than among populations or species. Regions of the

                  mechanisms that we call the cost of rarity
                  (Mechanism R) and the cost of commonness (Mechanism
                  C). These reduce the rate of population increase
                  only at high densities (asexual organisms) or both
                  at high and low densities (sexual species). The
                  theory predicts that, in certain circumstances, the
                  number of coexisting species in any assemblage will
                  be finite and that these species will differ in
                  their utilization of resources (and in associated
                  morphological traits) more than expected by
                  chance. Specifically, it predicts such nonrandom
                  assortment in assemblages of three or more
                  (i.e. multispecies) sexual species, especially in
                  those communities where a few species are
                  numerically dominant, but not in two-species
                  associations and not in asexual forms. Unlike other
                  theories, however, ours does not predict any
                  specific value of morphological ratio or limiting
                  similarity. We develop procedures to assess the
                  degree of numerical dominance in an assemblage, and
                  then test the predictions of the theory using data
                  on morphological size ratios. The tests yield
                  results that are consistent with the theory. Our
                  analysis of multispecies assemblages Of granivorous
                  rodents, bird-eating hawks, Anolis and sexual
                  Cnemidophorus lizards, show that in these
                  assemblages very small ratios are observed less
                  often than expected by chance. Coexisting asexual
                  Cnemidophorus lizards tend to be extremely similar
                  in size. Nesting sparrow and flycatcher assemblages
                  exhibit low numerical dominance which we predict
                  will inhibit detection of regular assortment, and we
                  find no regular pattern in these
                  assemblages. Finally, we fail to detect regular
                  assortment in most two-species associations as
                  expected. We examine several alternative mechanisms
                  that might account for morphological segregation
                  among coexisting species but find little evidence
                  that they have been important.},

                  survival and growth of 1- to 2-year-old seedlings of
                  Acer rubrum, Quercus rubra and Quercus alba. In
                  addition, although not statistically significant,
                  seedling survival of fire was higher at lower than
                  at higher fuel loading levels. Seedlings of Q. rubra
                  survived fire better than those of A. rubrum. This
                  superior survival was associated with a greater rate
                  of resprouting in Quercus after fire in the spring,
                  but not after an autumn fire. Starch concentrations
                  in roots fluctuated seasonally in all species,
                  reaching minimum levels in May. Seedlings of both
                  Quercus species maintained higher root starch levels
                  and greater seasonal stability in starch levels than
                  A. rubrum seedlings: results that may have
                  contributed to the superior resprouting capacity of
                  Quercus seedlings after spring fire. However, starch
                  reserves could not account for differences in autumn
                  fire survival, as starch concentrations in this
                  season were high and roughly equivalent in all
                  species, and there was little subsequent resprouting
                  observed in surviving seedlings of any species. The
                  lower rate of resprouting in A. rubrum seedlings may
                  be attributable to some combination of morphological
                  constraints and lack of starch reserves. Carbon
                  allocation patterns of Quercus seedlings apparently
                  favored maintenance of high root starch levels while
                  carbon allocation of A. rubrum seedlings apparently
                  favored rapid growth. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

                  biodiversity, whereas classical competition theory
                  seems to suggest that only a few competing species
                  can survive. Recently we suggested a new solution to
                  this plankton paradox. In theory, at least,
                  competition between multiple species can generate
                  complex dynamics that can support a large number of
                  species. How likely is it then, in reality, that
                  competitive chaos indeed promotes biodiversity? To
                  obtain some insight, we simulated multispecies
                  competition according to five different
                  physiological scenarios. For random species
                  parameters, biodiversity was generally low. Assuming
                  plausible physiological trade-offs, the simulations
                  revealed switches back and forth between equilibrium
                  and nonequilibrium dynamics, and a higher
                  biodiversity. An extremely high biodiversiry, with
                  sometimes more than 100 species on three resources,
                  was observed in simulations that assumed a cyclic
                  relation between competitive abilities and resource
                  contents. We conclude that physiological and
                  life-history patterns have a major impact on the
                  likelihood of nonequilibrium dynamics and on the
                  biodiversity of plankton communities.},

  abstract =     {Light is never distributed homogeneously since it
                  forms a gradient over biomass. As a consequence, the
                  common theories on nutrient competition are not
                  applicable to competition for light. In this paper,
                  we investigate a model for light-limited growth and
                  competition among phytoplankton species in a mixed
                  water column. The model is based on standard
                  assumptions such as Lambert-Beer's law of light
                  absorption, a Monod equation for carbon uptake, and
                  constant specific carbon losses. By introducing the
                  concept of quantum return, we show that the dynamics
                  of growth and competition can be quantified not only
                  in terms of depth but also directly in terms of
                  light availability. We argue that the crucial
                  measure for phytoplankton growth is not a ''critical
                  depth'' but a ''critical light intensity,''
                  I-out*. For each species, I-out* corresponds to the
                  equilibrium light intensity at the bottom of a water
                  column when the species is grown in
                  monoculture. I-out* plays a role similar to the
                  ''critical nutrient concentration'' R* used in
                  models of nutrient-limited growth. For a constant
                  light supply, the species with the lowest I-out*
                  will competitively exclude all other species. There
                  are, however, some important differences between R*
                  and I-out*. Whereas R* reflects both the local and
                  the total balance between nutrient uptake and
                  nutrient losses, I-out* only reflects the total
                  carbon balance. Moreover, I-out* decreases with
                  increasing light supply, whereas R* is independent
                  of the nutrient supply. As a consequence, (1) the
                  outcome of competition for light may depend on the
                  light supply, (2) the compensation point is not a
                  good predictor for the outcome of competition, (3)
                  the resource ratio hypothesis does not apply when
                  species compete for both nutrients and light. The
                  outcome of competition for nutrients and light may
                  depend on the nutrient and light supply, on the
                  mixing depth, and on the background turbidity due to
                  inanimate substances.},

                  biologists(1). In aquatic ecosystems, the
                  biodiversity puzzle is particularly troublesome, and
                  known as the 'paradox of the
                  plankton'(2). Competition theory predicts that, at
                  equilibrium, the number of coexisting species cannot
                  exceed the number of limiting resources(3-6). For
                  phytoplankton, only a few resources are potentially
                  limiting: nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, iron,
                  light, inorganic carbon, and sometimes a few trace
                  metals or vitamins. However, in natural waters
                  dozens of phytoplankton species coexist(2). Here we
                  offer a solution to the plankton paradox. First, we
                  show that resource competition models(6-10) can
                  generate oscillations and chaos when species compete
                  for three or more resources. Second we show that
                  these oscillations and chaotic fluctuations in
                  species abundances allow the coexistence of many
                  species on a handful of resources. This model of
                  planktonic biodiversity may be broadly applicable to
                  the biodiversity of many ecosystems.},

                  abundances; and (ii) these non-equilibrium dynamics
                  may favor a high biodiversity. These findings were
                  based on Liebig's Law of the Minimum, which assumes
                  that each species is limited by only one resource at
                  a time. In reality, however, resources can have
                  interactive effects on growth. Here, we investigate
                  whether competition for interactively essential
                  resources may generate oscillations and chaos as
                  well. Our results show that competition for

                  Phalacrus substriatus may act as vectors,
                  transmitting A. heterospora between different
                  C. nigra tussocks. Path analysis clearly showed that
                  the number of vectors on individual tussocks was an
                  important factor explaining levels of infection of
                  A. heterospora. 3 The year-to-year correlations in
                  incidence of A. heterospora disease for individual
                  C. nigra plants were high, indicating that the same
                  plants consistently experience high levels of
                  disease. There were also high year-to-year
                  correlations in the abundance of P. substriatus
                  beetles on individual plants. 4 A second natural
                  enemy of the sedge, the gall mite Phytoptus caricis,
                  also showed high between-year correlations in levels
                  of infestation. Since P. caricis competes for the
                  same resource as A. heterospora, we predicted that
                  high levels of P. caricis infestation should have a
                  negative effect on disease levels. However, there
                  was in general a positive effect of P. caricis
                  infestation on A. heterospora disease levels. 5 This
                  study shows that for understanding levels of disease
                  of A. heterospora, both within-year effects as well
                  as transient effects must be included. Phenotypic
                  variation among plants in susceptibility to
                  infection by A. heterospora could explain the
                  observed patterns of disease but they could also be

  abstract =     {We analyse the population dynamics of two strains of
                  bacteria (Escherichia coli): one strain produces a
                  toxin (called colicin) that increases the mortality
                  of a colicin-sensitive strain in the neighbourhood,
                  but does not harm the colicin-producing strain
                  itself. On the other hand, in the absence of colicin
                  in the environment: the colicin-sensitive strain
                  enjoys a higher population growth rate. The model is
                  closely related to the evolutionary dynamics of
                  social interaction. It has been established
                  previously that a perfectly mixing population shows
                  bistability; that is, whichever strain dominates
                  initially tends to defeat the other. On the other
                  hand, empirical and computer simulation results in
                  lattice structured populations show neither
                  co-existence nor bistability of the two strains. In
                  this paper, we analyse the lattice model based on
                  pair approximation (forming a system of ordinary
                  differential equations of global densities and local
                  densities), and by the direct computer simulation of
                  the spatial stochastic model. Both the pair
                  approximation dynamics and the computer simulation
                  show that, for most regions of parameter values, one
                  strain defeats the other, irrespective of the
                  initial abundance. However, the pair approximation
                  analysis also suggests a relatively narrow parameter
                  region of bistability, which should disappear when
                  the model is considered on a lattice of infinitely
                  large size. The biological implications of the
                  results and the relationship of the present model
                  with other models of the evolution of spite or
                  altruistic behaviours are discussed. This suggests
                  that the dynamics reflected by the spatially
                  explicit lattice model may be sufficient, perhaps
                  even necessary, to support the evolution of
                  colicin.},

                  negative versus positive allometry of defense, that
                  is, early versus delayed defensive investment,
                  depends on the forms of the relationships between
                  body size and growth, body size and mortality
                  deterrence, and defense size and mortality
                  deterrence. Positive allometry is favored by
                  strongly sigmoidal growth, a strongly convex
                  body-size/deterrence relationship, and a concave
                  defense-size/deterrence relationship. Rapid early
                  growth, a weakly convex body-size/deterrence
                  relationship, and a convex defense-size/deterrence
                  relationship favor negative allometry. The model is
                  tested by comparing, among Pinus and Quercus
                  species, measured intraspecific bark allometry with
                  a predicted ranking of bark allometry along the
                  negative-positive continuum. The ranking is based on
                  the forms of body-size/deterrence and
                  defense-size/deterrence relationships expected in
                  each species' typical habitat given the fire regime
                  and canopy type. This predicted ranking of bark
                  allometry is significantly correlated with measured
                  bark allometry. Negative bark allometry and thick
                  sapling bark are associated with habitats
                  characterized by frequent low-intensity fire and
                  relatively open canopies. Fire-resilient Pinus

                  dosed-canopy forests tend to have positive bark

                  xylem was investigated in Malosma laurina and
                  Heteromeles arbutifolia, two chaparral shrub species
                  of southern California, We tested the hypothesis
                  that the primary cause of xylem dysfunction in these
                  species during dehydration was the pulling of air
                  through the pores in the cell walls of vessels
                  (pores in pit membranes) as a result of high
                  tensions on xylem water, First, we constructed
                  vulnerability-to-embolism curves for (i) excised
                  branches that were increasingly dehydrated in the
                  laboratory and (ii) hydrated branches exposed to
                  increasing levels of external air pressure, Branches
                  of M. laurina that were dehydrated became 50%
                  embolized at a xylem pressure potential of -1.6 MPa,
                  which is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to
                  the +1.6 MPa of external air pressure that caused
                  50% embolism in hydrated stems, Dehydrated and
                  pressurized branches of H. arbutifolia reached a 50%
                  level of embolism at -6.0 and +6.4 MPa,
                  respectively. Secondly, polystyrene spheres ranging
                  in diameter from 20 to 149 nm were perfused through
                  hydrated stem segments to estimate the pore size in
                  the vessel cell walls (pit membranes) of the two
                  species, A 50% or greater reduction in hydraulic
                  conductivity occurred in M. laurina at perfusions of
                  30, 42, 64 and 82 nm spheres and in H. arbutifolia
                  at perfusions of 20 and 30 nm spheres, Application
                  of the capillary equation to these pore diameters
                  predicted 50% embolism at xylem tensions of -2.2 MPa
                  for M. laurina and -6.7 MPa for H. arbutifolia,
                  which are within 0.7 MPa of the actual values, Our
                  results suggest that the size of pores in pit
                  membranes may be a factor in determining both xylem
                  efficiency and vulnerability to embolism in some
                  chaparral species, H, arbutifolia, with smaller
                  pores and narrower vessels, withstands lower water
                  potentials but has lower transport efficiency, M,
                  laurina, with wider pores and wider vessels, has a
                  greater transport efficiency but requires a deeper
                  root system to help avoid catastrophically low water
                  potentials.},

                  are not well understood. These pines occur in arid
                  and semi-arid foothills and mountains of California
                  that are subjected to frequent fires. Cone and seed
                  traits of these three California pines are compared
                  to those of four species of pines (sugar pine,
                  P. lambertiana; Jeffrey pine, P. jeffreyi; ponderosa
                  pine, P. ponderosa; and lodgepole pine, P. contorta)
                  that occur in more mesic environments in the nearby
                  Sierra Nevada mountains. The cones of the Sabinianae
                  pines are large with thick, dense scales, and the
                  scales of gray and Coulter pines are armed with
                  sharp, recurved spines. The seeds of all three
                  species are large, and those of gray and Torrey
                  pines are nearly wingless. In contrast, the Sierra
                  Nevada pines have small to medium-sized seeds with
                  large wings that are initially dispersed by the
                  wind. Heavy wing loading of the Sabinianae pine
                  seeds causes them to fall rapidly, and they are not
                  dispersed far by wind. However, animals remove the
                  fallen seeds rapidly, and rodents and jays scatter
                  hoarded many seeds in the soil. This caching
                  activity results in seedling establishment. The
                  unusual morphology of the cones and seeds of the
                  Sabinianae pines is interpreted as a combination of
                  traits that attract animal dispersers, thwart the
                  foraging activities of seed predators, and promote
                  the survival of seeds in an environment subject to
                  frequent fires.},

  abstract =     {Ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or
                  indirectly modulate the availability of resources to
                  other species, by causing physical state changes in
                  biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they
                  modify, maintain and create habitats. Autogenic
                  engineers (e.g. corals, or trees) change the
                  environment via their own physical structures
                  (i.e. their living and dead tissues). Allogenic
                  engineers (e.g. woodpeckers, beavers) change the
                  environment by transforming living or non-living
                  materials from one physical state to another, via
                  mechanical or other means. The direct provision of
                  resources to other species, in the form of living or
                  dead tissues is not engineering. Organisms act as
                  engineers when they modulate the supply of a
                  resource or resources other than themselves. We
                  recognise and define five types of engineering and
                  provide examples. Humans are allogenic engineers par
                  excellence, and also mimic the behaviour of
                  autogenic engineers, for example by constructing
                  glasshouses. We explore related concepts including
                  the notions of extended phenotypes and keystone
                  species. Some (but not all) products of ecosystem
                  engineering are extended phenotypes. Many (perhaps
                  most) impacts of keystone species include not only
                  trophic effects, but also engineers and
                  engineering. Engineers differ in their impacts. The
                  biggest effects are attributable to species with
                  large per capita impacts, living at high densities,
                  over large areas for a long time, giving rise to
                  structures that persist for millennia and that
                  modulate many resource flows (e.g. mima mounds
                  created by fossorial rodents). The ephemeral nests
                  constructed by small, passerine birds lie at the
                  opposite end of this continuum. We provide a
                  tentative research agenda for an exploration of the
                  phenomenon of organisms as ecosystem engineers, and
                  suggest that all habitats on earth support, and are
                  influenced by, ecosystem engineers.},

  abstract =     {Physical ecosystem engineers are organisms that
                  directly or indirectly control the availability of
                  resources to other organisms by causing physical
                  state changes in biotic or abiotic
                  materials. Physical ecosystem engineering by
                  organisms is the physical modification, maintenance,
                  or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of
                  engineers on many other species occur in virtually
                  all ecosystems because the physical state changes
                  directly create nonfood resources such as living
                  space, directly control abiotic resources, and
                  indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn,
                  affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic
                  interactions and resource competition do not
                  constitute engineering. Engineering can have
                  significant or trivial effects on other species, may
                  involve the physical structure of an organism (like
                  a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a
                  beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have
                  feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that
                  engineering has both negative and positive effects
                  on species richness and abundances at small scales,
                  but the net effects are probably positive at larger
                  scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered
                  environments in ecological and evolutionary space
                  and time. Models of the population dynamics of
                  engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat
                  equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable
                  and may show long-term cycles, with potential
                  ramifications for community and ecosystem
                  stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize
                  such a model do not exist for any engineer
                  species. Because engineers control flows of energy
                  and materials but do not have to participate in
                  these flows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not
                  appear to be useful in predicting which engineers
                  will have big effects. Empirical observations
                  suggest some potential generalizations about which
                  species will be important engineers in which
                  ecosystems. We point out some of the obvious, and
                  not so obvious, ways in which engineering and
                  trophic relations interact, and we call for greater
                  research on physical ecosystem engineers, their
                  impacts, and their interface with trophic
                  relations.},

                  fruits has been explained as the result of
                  adaptations to their mutualistic seed dispersers. By
                  analyzing the information available on fleshy fruit
                  characteristics of 910 angiosperm species, I assess
                  the hypothesis of evolutionary association between

                  (birds, mammals, and mixed dispersers) and address
                  explicitly and quantitatively alternative null
                  hypotheses about phylogenetic effects. Phylogenetic
                  affinity among plant taxa is accounted for by
                  comparative methods including nested ANOVA,
                  phylogenetic autocorrelation, and independent
                  contrasts. Averaging over the 16 fruit traits
                  examined, phylogenetic effects down to genus level
                  explain 61% of total variance. Phylogenetic
                  autocorrelations are strong among close relatives,
                  reaching significance for 11 of the 16 fruit traits
                  examined. When assessed by independent contrast
                  methods, correlated evolution between type of
                  disperser and fruit traits is confined to fruit
                  diameter. Differences among dispersal syndromes in
                  other traits vanish after accounting for
                  phylogenetic effects. These analyses reveal that
                  seed dispersal syndromes are not entirely
                  interpretable as current adaptations to seed
                  dispersers. Their status as exaptations can be
                  assessed by combining experimental studies of
                  natural selection on fruit size and rigorous
                  comparative and cladistic tests of adaptational

  abstract =     {It has been suggested that abortion of ovules in
                  perennials is caused partly by early acting genetic
                  load (abortions due to 'bad offspring'). However, it
                  is still unclear what proportion of abortions of
                  naturally pollinated seeds are due to early genetic
                  load. Here we suggest that variation between
                  maternal genotypes (abortions due to 'bad maternal
                  genotypes') may be an even more important factor
                  causing genetic abortions than early load, based on
                  results from Scots pine. The early load is severe in
                  Scots pine: in experimental self-pollinations on
                  average 76% of the seeds were aborted. Comparison of
                  naturally pollinated and experimentally
                  cross-pollinated seeds showed that the abortion rate
                  of naturally pollinated seeds was only slightly, and
                  not statistically significantly, higher than that of
                  experimentally cross-pollinated seeds (30%
                  vs. 26.5%, respectively). Thus, although early load
                  can be high under self-pollination in Scots pine, it
                  does not account for a high share of abortions of
                  naturally pollinated seeds. Instead, maternal
                  genotype determined the seed abortion rate: in a
                  separate experiment using an experimental population
                  (clonal stand), 29% of the total variance in seed
                  abortion was due to variation between maternal
                  genotypes. We studied further whether 'bad maternal
                  genotypes' could be explained by trade-offs between
                  seed abortion and other fitness functions. Only one
                  statistically significant genetic correlation was
                  found, a positive association between cone
                  production and successful seed development. Thus
                  'bad maternal genotypes' aborted a higher proportion
                  of their seed and produced less cones than the 'good
                  maternal genotypes'.},

                  rates (e. g., due to wind or current) for adaptive
                  evolution in a system of two habitat
                  patches. Asymmetric dispersal rates can lead to
                  overcrowding of the 'downstream' habitat, resulting
                  in a source-sink population structure in the absence
                  of intrinsic quality differences between habitats or
                  can even cause an intrinsically better habitat to
                  function as a sink. Source-sink population structure
                  due to asymmetric dispersal rates has similar
                  consequences for adaptive evolution as a source-sink
                  structure due to habitat quality differences:
                  natural selection tends to be biased toward the
                  source habitat. We demonstrate this for two models
                  of adaptive evolution: invasion of a rare allele
                  that improves fitness in one habitat but reduces it
                  in the other and antagonistic selection on a
                  quantitative trait determined by five additive
                  loci. If a habitat can sustain a population without
                  immigration, the conditions for adaptation to that
                  habitat are most favorable if there is little or no
                  immigration from the other habitat; the influence of
                  emigration depends on the magnitude of the allelic
                  effects involved and other parameters. If, however,

                  settlers facilitated pine invasion of grassy

                  stand-replating fires, motivating ecological
                  restoration through thinning and prescribed burning,
                  We used in situ soil respiration over a 2-yr period
                  to assess belowground responses to pine invasion and
                  restoration in a ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystem
                  near Flagstaff, AZ. Replicated restoration
                  treatments were: (i) partial restoration - thinning
                  to presettlement conditions; (ii) complete
                  restoration - removing trees and forest floor
                  material to presettlement conditions, native grass
                  litter addition, and prescribed burning; and (iii)
                  control. Within treatments, we sampled beneath
                  different canopy types to assess the effects of pine
                  invasion into grassy openings on soil
                  respiration. Growing season soil respiration was
                  greater in the complete restoration (346 +/- 24 g
                  CO2-C m(-2)) and control (350 +/- 8 g CO2-C m(-2))
                  than the partial restoration (301 +/- 5 g CO2-C
                  m(-2)) in 1995. In 1996, the complete (364 +/- 17 g
                  CO2-C m(-2)) and partial (328 +/- 7 g CO2-C m(-2))
                  restoration treatments had greater growing season
                  respiration rates than the control (302 +/- 13 g
                  CO2-C m(-2)). Results suggest that restoration
                  effects on soil respiration depend on interannual
                  soil water patterns and may not significantly alter
                  regional C cycles. Soil respiration from grassy
                  openings was 15% greater than from soil beneath
                  presettlement or postsettlement pines in 1995 and
                  1996. A lack of active management will decrease
                  belowground catabolism if pines continue to expand
                  at the expense of grassy openings.},

                  fire-prone communities dominated by species
                  exhibiting remarkable similarities in germination
                  response. In both regions there are a substantial
                  number of species with germination stimulated
                  chemically by charred wood and smoke. This type of
                  germination behaviour has arisen independently in
                  distantly related families and is interpreted as
                  convergent evolution. Heat-shock is also an
                  important germination trigger that is widespread,
                  although in both regions it is most common in the
                  same families. Phylogeney may play an important role
                  in the presence of this postfire germination cue in
                  both regions, but a much more rigorous analysis is
                  required to show that this trait represents a single
                  unique event in each lineage. In both regions,
                  germination response is not randomly distributed
                  across growth forms and there are marked regional
                  similarities in the type of germination behaviour
                  associated with certain growth forms. Geophytes
                  largely lack refractory seeds, which require
                  fire-type cues for germination, but the presence of
                  fire-stimulated flowering of bulbs and corms may
                  time recruitment to subsequent postfire
                  years. Annuals that cue germination to postfire
                  conditions are predominantly triggered by chemicals

                  larger, more intense wildfires. However, analysis of
                  the California Statewide Fire History Database shows
                  that, since 1910, fire frequency and area burned
                  have not declined, and fire size has not
                  increased. Fire rotation intervals have declined,
                  and fire season has not changed, implying that fire
                  intensity has not increased. Fire frequency and
                  population density were correlated, and it is
                  suggested that fire suppression plays a critical
                  role in offsetting potential impacts of increased
                  ignitions. Large fires were not dependent on old age
                  classes of fuels, and it is thus unlikely that age
                  class manipulation of fuels can prevent large
                  fires. Expansion of the urban-wildland interface is

                  richness, is typically highest in the early
                  post-fire years in California shrublands. However,
                  this generalization is overly simplistic and the
                  present study demonstrates that diversity is
                  determined by a complex of temporal and spatial
                  effects. Ninety sites distributed across southern
                  California were studied for 5 years after a series
                  of fires. Characteristics of the disturbance event,
                  in this case fire severity, call alter post-fire
                  diversity, both decreasing and increasing diversity,
                  depending on life form. Spatial variability in
                  resource availability is an important factor
                  explaining patterns of diversity, and there is a
                  complex interaction between landscape features and
                  life form. Temporal variability in resource
                  availability affects diversity, and the diversity
                  peak in the immediate post-fire year (or two)
                  appears to be driven by factors different from
                  subsequent diversity peaks. Early post-fire
                  diversity is influenced by life-history
                  specialization, illustrated by species that spend
                  the bulk of their life cycle as a dormant seed bank,
                  which is then triggered to germinate by
                  fire. Resource fluctuations, precipitation in
                  particular, may be associated with subsequent
                  post-fire diversity peaks. These later peaks in
                  diversity comprise a flora that is compositionally
                  different from the immediate post-fire flora, and
                  their presence may be due to mass effects from
                  population expansion of local populations in
                  adjacent burned areas.},

                  shrublands were studied for five years after fires
                  in order to evaluate hypothesized determinants of
                  postfire recovery and succession. Residual species
                  present in the immediate postfire environment
                  dominated early succession. By the fifth year
                  postfire, roughly half of the species were
                  colonizers not present in the first year, but they
                  comprised only 7-14% cover. Successional changes
                  were evaluated in the context of four,hypotheses:
                  (1) event-dependent, (2) fire interval, (3)
                  self-regulatory, and (4) environmental filter
                  hypotheses. Characteristics specific to the fire
                  event, for example, fire severity and annual
                  fluctuations in precipitation, were important
                  determinants of patterns of change in cover and
                  density, supporting the "event-dependent"
                  hypothesis. The "fire interval" hypothesis is also
                  supported, primarily through the impact of short
                  intervals on reproductive failure in obligate
                  seeding shrubs and the impact of long intervals on
                  fuel accumulation and resultant fire
                  severity. Successional changes in woody cover were
                  correlated with decreases in herb cover, indicating
                  support for "self-regulatory" effects. Across this
                  landscape there were strong "environmental filter"
                  effects that resulted in complex patterns of
                  postfire recovery and succession between coastal and
                  interior associations of both vegetation types. Of
                  relevance to fire managers is the finding that
                  postfire recovery patterns are substantially slower
                  in the interior sage scrub formations, and thus
                  require different management strategies than coastal
                  formations. Also, in sage scrub (but not chaparral),
                  prefire stand age is positively correlated with fire
                  severity, and negatively correlated with postfire
                  cover. Differential responses to fire severity
                  Suggest that landscapes with combinations of high
                  and low severity may lead to enhanced
                  biodiversity. Predicting postfire management needs
                  is complicated by the fact that vegetation recovery
                  is significantly controlled by patterns of
                  precipitation.},

  abstract =     {1. Smoke-stimulated germination in the post-fire
                  flora of California chaparral does not appear to be
                  triggered by nitrate. Application of freshly
                  prepared unbuffered KNO-3 solutions (pH c. 6.2)
                  failed to enhance germination of five populations of
                  Emmenanthe penduliflora or one Phacelia grandiflora
                  population, regardless of light or stratification
                  conditions. 2. KNO-3 buffered at acidic pH (or
                  unbuffered solutions equilibrated with atmospheric
                  CO-2) did induce germination, but KNO-3 solutions at
                  pH 7 failed to induce germination. Induction of
                  germination is therefore not due to the nitrate ion
                  per se, but rather to high (H+), although buffered
                  controls gave weak germination at low pH, suggesting
                  a role for H+ plus nitrate. However, other anions
                  such as sulphate were equally as effective as
                  nitrate at breaking dormancy. 3. The germination
                  response to KNO-3 was affected by the type of filter
                  paper used and this may be linked to differences in
                  pH. 4. NO-2, at concentrations present in biomass
                  smoke, was highly effective at inducing germination,
                  and other oxidizing agents also induced
                  germination. 5. Several growth regulators, including
                  nitrite and gibberellin, were stimulatory only at
                  acidic pH, but KCN was stimulatory across a broad pH
                  range. 6. Germination decreased at smoke exposures
                  longer than a few minutes. Also, smoked water
                  samples effective at breaking dormancy were acidic
                  and were less effective when buffered to pH gt
                  7. 7. Physical scarification of the seed coat
                  induced germination but the effect was not due to
                  penetration of a water barrier, or to enhanced
                  oxygen uptake or to wound responses such as CO-2 or
                  ethylene production. 8. Different effects of the
                  gibberellin inhibitor CCC (chlorocholine chloride)
                  suggested that the mechanisms of
                  scarification-induced and smoke-induced germination
                  may differ. 9. We conclude that either oxidizing
                  gases in smoke and/or acids generated on burnt sites
                  play a role in germination of post-fire annuals in
                  chaparral.},

  abstract =     {Patterns of native and alien plant diversity in
                  response to disturbance were examined along an
                  elevational gradient in blue oak savanna, chaparral,
                  and coniferous forests. Total species richness,
                  alien species richness, and alien cover declined
                  with elevation, at scales from 1 to 1000 m(2). We
                  found no support for the hypothesis that community
                  diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1-m(2)
                  point scale, where we would expect competitive
                  interactions between the largely herbaceous flora to
                  be most intense, alien species richness as well as
                  alien cover increased with increasing native species
                  richness in all communities. This suggests that
                  aliens are limited not by the number of native
                  competitors, but by resources that affect
                  establishment of both natives and aliens. Blue-oak
                  savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and
                  consistently had more alien than native species at
                  the 1-m(2) scale. All of these aliens are annuals,
                  and it is widely thought that they have displaced
                  native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens
                  have greatly increased species
                  richness. Alternatively, there is a rich regional
                  flora of native annual forbs that could have
                  dominated these grasslands prior to displacement by
                  alien grasses. On our sites, livestock grazing
                  increased the number of alien species and alien
                  cover only slightly over that of sites free of
                  livestock grazing for more than a century,
                  indicating some level of permanency to this
                  invasion. In chaparral,,both diversity and aliens
                  increased markedly several years after
                  fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed
                  shrublands, and alien propagules fail to survive the
                  natural crown fires in these ecosystems. Thus,
                  aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as
                  a consequence, time since fire is an important
                  determinant of invasive presence. Blue oak savannas
                  are an important propagule source for alien species
                  because they maintain permanent populations of all
                  alien species encountered in postfire chaparral, and
                  because the vegetation mosaic in this region places
                  them in proximity to chaparral. The speed at which
                  alien propagules reach a burned site and the speed
                  at which the shrublands return to their former
                  closed-canopy condition determine alien
                  invasion. Frequent burning of this vegetation alters
                  the balance in favor of alien invasion. In the
                  higher-elevation coniferous forests, species
                  diversity was a function of fire severity and time
                  since fire. High-intensity fires create gaps that
                  decrease canopy coverage and increase light levels
                  and nutrients for an ephemeral successional
                  flora. Few species have persistent seed banks, so
                  the time since fire is an important determinant of
                  colonization success. There was a highly significant
                  interaction between fire severity and time since
                  fire for understory cover, species richness, and
                  alien richness and cover. Understory was sparse in
                  the first year after fire, particularly in
                  low-severity burns, and increased substantially
                  several years after fire, particularly on
                  high-severity burns. Both fire severity and time
                  since fire affected alien species richness and
                  dominance. Coniferous forests had about one-third as
                  many alien species as the foothill oak savannas, and
                  fewer than half of the species were shared between
                  these communities. Unburned coniferous forests were
                  largely free of alien species, whereas some burned
                  sites had a significant alien presence, which
                  presents a challenge for fire restoration of these
                  forests.},

                  shrubland dominated landscapes are evaluated
                  relative to the natural lightning fire potential for
                  affecting landscape patterns. Location Focus was on
                  the coastal ranges of central and southern
                  California. Methods Potential patterns of Indian
                  burning were evaluated based upon historical
                  documents, ethnographic accounts, archaeological
                  records and consideration of contemporary land
                  management tactics. Patterns of vegetation
                  distribution in this region were evaluated relative
                  to environmental factors and the resilience of the
                  dominant shrub vegetation to different fire
                  frequencies. Results Lightning fire frequency in
                  this region is one of the lowest in North America
                  and the density of pre-Columbian populations was one
                  of the highest. Shrublands dominate the landscape
                  throughout most of the region. These woody
                  communities have weak resilience to high fire
                  frequency and are readily displaced by annual
                  grasses and forbs under high fire frequency. Intact
                  shrublands provided limited resources for native
                  Americans and thus there was ample motivation for
                  using fire to degrade this vegetation to an open
                  mosaic of shrubland/grassland, not unlike the
                  agropastoral modification of ecologically related
                  shrublands by Holocene peoples in the Mediterranean
                  Basin. Alien-dominated grasslands currently cover
                  approximately one-quarter of the landscape and less
                  than 1% of these grasslands have a significant
                  native grass presence. Ecological studies in the
                  Californian coastal ranges have failed to uncover
                  any clear soil or climate factors explaining
                  grassland and shrubland distribution patterns. Main
                  conclusions Coastal ranges of California were
                  regions of high Indian density and low frequency of
                  lightning fires. The natural vegetation dominants on
                  this landscape are shrubland vegetation that often
                  form dense impenetrable stands with limited
                  resources for Native Americans. Natural fire
                  frequencies are not high enough to maintain these
                  landscapes in habitable mixtures of shrublands and
                  grasslands but such landscape mosaics are readily
                  produced with additional human subsidy of
                  ignitions. It is hypothesized that a substantial
                  fraction of the landscape was type converted from
                  shrubland to grassland and much of the landscape
                  that underwent such type conversion has either been
                  maintained by Euro-American land management
                  practices or resisted recolonization of native
                  shrublands. It appears that these patterns are
                  disturbance dependent and result from anthropogenic
                  alteration of landscapes initiated by Native
                  Americans and sustained and expanded upon by
                  Euro-American settlers.},

  abstract =     {Fire management of California shrublands has been
                  heavily influenced by policies designed for
                  coniferous forests, however, fire suppression has
                  not effectively excluded fire from chaparral and
                  coastal sage scrub landscapes and catastrophic
                  wildfires are not the result of unnatural fuel
                  accumulation. There is no evidence that prescribed
                  burning in these shrublands provides any resource
                  benefit and in some areas may negatively impact
                  shrublands by increasing fire frequency. Therefore,
                  fire hazard reduction is the primary justification
                  for prescription burning, but it is doubtful that
                  rotational burning to create landscape age mosaics
                  is a cost effective method of controlling
                  catastrophic wildfires, There are problems with
                  prescription burning in this crown-fire ecosystem
                  that are not shared by forests with a natural
                  surface-fire regime, Prescription weather conditions
                  preclude burning at rotation intervals sufficient to
                  effect the control of fires ignited under severe
                  weather conditions. Fire management should focus on
                  strategic placement of prescription burns to both
                  insure the most efficient fire hazard reduction and
                  to minimize the amount of landscape exposed to
                  unnaturally high fire frequency. A major contributor
                  to increased fire suppression costs and increased
                  loss of property and lives is the continued urban
                  sprawl into wildlands naturally subjected to high
                  intensity crown fires. Differences in shrubland fire
                  history suggest there may be a need for different
                  fire management tactics between central coastal and
                  southern California. Much less is known about
                  shrubland fire history in the Sierra Nevada
                  foothills and interior North Coast Ranges, and thus
                  it would be prudent to not transfer these ideas too
                  broadly across the range of chaparral until we have
                  a clearer understanding of the extent of regional
                  variation in shrubland fire regimes.},

  abstract =     {The San Francisco East Bay landscape is a rich
                  mosaic of grasslands, shrublands and woodlands that
                  is experiencing losses of grassland due to
                  colonization by shrubs and succession towards
                  woodland associations. The instability of these
                  grasslands is apparently due to their disturbance-
                  dependent nature coupled with 20th century changes
                  in fire and grazing activity. This study uses fire
                  history records to determine the potential for fire
                  in this region and for evidence of changes in the
                  second half of the 20th century that would account
                  for shrubland expansion. This region has a largely
                  anthropogenic fire regime with no lightning- ignited
                  fires in most years. Fire suppression policy has not
                  excluded fire from this region; however, it has been
                  effective at maintaining roughly similar burning
                  levels in the face of increasing anthropogenic
                  fires, and effective at decreasing the size of
                  fires. Fire frequency parallels increasing
                  population growth until the latter part of the 20th
                  century, when it reached a plateau. Fire does not
                  appear to have been a major factor in the shrub
                  colonization of grasslands, and cessation of grazing
                  is a more likely immediate cause. Because grasslands
                  are not under strong edaphic control, rather their
                  distribution appears to be disturbance-dependent,
                  and natural lightning ignitions are rare in the
                  region, I hypothesize that, before the entrance of
                  people into the region, grasslands were of limited
                  extent. Native Americans played a major role in
                  creation of grasslands through repeated burning and
                  these disturbance- dependent grasslands were
                  maintained by early European settlers through
                  overstocking of these range lands with cattle and
                  sheep. Twentieth century reduction in grazing,
                  coupled with a lack of natural fires and effective
                  suppression of anthropogenic fires, have acted in
                  concert to favor shrubland expansion.},

  abstract =     {Fire management practices affect alien plant
                  invasions in diverse ways. I considered the impact
                  of six fire management practices on alien invasions:
                  fire suppression, forest fuel reduction,
                  prescription burning in crown-fire ecosystems, fuel
                  breaks, targeting of noxious aliens, and postfire
                  rehabilitation. Most western United States forests
                  have had fire successfully excluded for unnaturally
                  long periods of time, and this appears to have
                  favored the exclusion of alien plant species. Forest
                  fuel reduction programs have the potential for
                  greatly enhancing forest vulnerability to alien
                  invasions. In part this is due to the focus on
                  reestablishing pre-Euro-American fire regimes on a
                  landscape that differs from pre-Euro-American
                  landscapes in the abundance of aggressive non-native
                  species. We may be forced to choose between
                  restoring "natural" fire regimes or altering fire
                  regimes to favor communities of native
                  species. Intensive grazing in many western forests
                  may exacerbate the alien problem after fire and
                  temporally decoupling grazing and fire restoration
                  may reduce the alien threat. Many shrubland
                  ecosystems such as the Intermountain West sagebrush
                  steppe or California chaparral have a natural,
                  high-intensity crown fire regime that is less
                  amenable to forest restoration tactics. Historical
                  use of prescribed fire for type conversion of
                  shrublands to more useful grazing lands has played
                  some role in the massive annual grass invasion that
                  threatens these shrublands. Fuel breaks pose a
                  special invasive plant risk because they promote
                  alien invasion along corridors into wildland
                  areas. Use of prescription burning to eliminate
                  noxious aliens has had questionable success,
                  particularly when applied to disturbance-dependent
                  annuals, and success is most likely when coupled
                  with ecosystem restoration that alters the
                  competitive balance between aliens and
                  natives. Artificial seeding of alien species as a
                  form of postfire stabilization appears to cause more
                  problems than it solves and may even enhance alien
                  invasion.},

                  post-fire growth, timing and mode of reproduction
                  and competitive status. The model assumes no
                  recruitment without fire and a simple competitive
                  hierarchy based on vertical stature. A critical
                  feature of the model is an initial post-fire window
                  of 5-6 yr in which competition from overstorey
                  species on understorey species is
                  reduced. Understorey functional groups differ in
                  their ability to exploit this window. In the field,
                  we tested five predictions derived from the model:
                  (a) overall species richness of understorey varies
                  inversely with overstorey density as a result of a
                  trend in richness of woody species, but not in
                  herbaceous species; (b) where an overstorey was
                  present in the previous fire interval, post-fire
                  population density is reduced in a functional group
                  of understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, but
                  not in a group of understorey obligate-seeding
                  shrubs with soil seed banks; (c) in understorey
                  serotinous resprouting shrubs, post-fire regrowth in
                  resprouting individuals is adversely affected by the
                  presence of an overstorey in the preceding fire
                  interval; (d) in understorey serotinous resprouting
                  shrubs, levels of pre-fire propagules are lower in
                  the presence of an overstorey, reducing the density
                  of post-fire recruits; and (e) in understorey
                  serotinous resprouting shrubs, recruitment relative
                  to the pre-fire population is unaffected by
                  overstorey species within the window of reduced
                  competition. Of these, three tests (a,b,d) supported
                  the model, one (e) may support the model, but the
                  results were inconclusive and one (c) did not
                  support the model. Limitations and further
                  applications of the model are discussed. Our results
                  suggest that maintenance of high densities of
                  overstorey populations is in conflict with
                  conservation of some understorey species. Models of
                  the type we propose will help identify and resolve
                  such conflicts and promote the judicious use of fire
                  to maintain full species diversity of plants.},

                  duplicity: even if subpopulations are reliably
                  extinction-prone, asynchrony in local extinctions
                  and recolonizations makes global persistence
                  possible(1-8). Migration is a double-edged sword in
                  such cases: too little migration prevents
                  recolonization of extinct patches, whereas too much
                  synchronizes subpopulations, raising the likelihood
                  of global extinction. Both edges of this proverbial
                  sword have been explored by manipulating the rate of
                  migration within experimental
                  populations(1,3-6,8). However, few experiments have
                  examined how the evolutionary ecology of fragmented
                  populations depends on the pattern of
                  migration(5). Here, we show that the migration
                  pattern affects both coexistence and evolution
                  within a community of bacterial hosts (Escherichia
                  coli) and viral pathogens (T4 coliphage) distributed
                  across a large network of subpopulations. In
                  particular, different patterns of migration select
                  for distinct pathogen strategies, which we term
                  'rapacious' and 'prudent'. These strategies define a
                  'tragedy of the commons'(9): rapacious phage
                  displace prudent variants for shared host resources,
                  but prudent phage are more productive when alone. We
                  find that prudent phage dominate when migration is
                  spatially restricted, while rapacious phage evolve
                  under unrestricted migration. Thus, migration
                  pattern alone can determine whether a de novo
                  tragedy of the commons is resolved in favour of
                  restraint.},

                  model, we studied the evolution and impact of
                  flammable traits in resprouting plants. A
                  flammability locus' determines the flammable
                  character of a plant and the frequency of alleles at
                  this locus affects the probability that any plant in
                  the population will burn. A linked 'disturbance
                  locus' determines how a plant fares in the presence
                  or absence of fire. Thus, the frequencies of alleles
                  at the flammability locus influence evolution at the
                  disturbance locus. The evolution of
                  flammability-enhancing alleles is influenced by
                  asymmetries in the genotypic fitnesses as well as by
                  the base flammability of the population and the
                  genetic structure of the system (with tighter
                  linkage increasing the possibility that the
                  population becomes more flammable). We demonstrate
                  that stable polymorphisms of plants differing in
                  flammability alleles are possible. The magnitude of
                  the organism's impact on the flammable character of
                  the environment influences where such polymorphisms
                  are expected. Furthermore, predictions concerning
                  the evolution of alleles at the disturbance locus
                  based solely on fitness asymmetries may fail due to
                  the influence of plants on their
                  environment. Unusual population dynamics, including
                  stable and unstable cycles of genotypes, are also
                  presented. The relation of this model to the Mutch
                  hypothesis and the recently developed theories of
                  'niche construction' and 'ecosystem engineering' is

                  U.S. coastal plain differ from those in the rest of
                  the species' range by having black heads with white
                  nose and ears. Postcranially on the dorsum, they
                  also show interindividual colour variation, ranging
                  from all-light agouti to all-black non-agouti. I
                  present results of experiments undertaken to test
                  whether the evolution of these pigmentary features
                  can be attributed to interactions with
                  predators. Comparative static crypsis (when the
                  squirrels are still) was tested by determining how
                  well specimens of the squirrel morphs matched their
                  backgrounds in terms of intensity (brightness)
                  distributions and patch size. Comparative dynamic
                  effects (when the squirrels are moving) were tested
                  using captive red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis)
                  and models of the fox squirrel morphs. Results
                  indicated that morphs of coastal-plain fox squirrels
                  with all-light backs are better static matches to
                  unburned backgrounds than are the darker morphs with
                  which they coexist. Against fire-blackened
                  backgrounds, fox squirrel morphs with intermediate
                  and all-black backs are better intensity matches
                  than those with all-light backs, but the dark morphs
                  are not better patch-length matches than light
                  morphs. The superiority of dark morphs in intensity
                  matching for a short time after a fire does not seem
                  sufficient to account for their long-term
                  maintenance. Hawks responded more slowly to moving
                  fox squirrel models with intermediate amounts of
                  black on the back than to all-light or all-dark
                  morphs; this result suggests a possible factor that
                  would favour retention of genes for dorsal blackness
                  in the coastal-plain population. Patchy black and
                  white heads appear to promote static crypsis of
                  south-eastern fox squirrels, and hawks reacted more
                  slowly to moving squirrel models with such
                  colouration than to those with plain heads.},

                  species, successional dynamics, and species loss
                  under habitat destruction. This class of models
                  assumes that there is an inverse relationship
                  between competitive ability and colonization ability
                  and that competitively superior species exclude
                  competitively inferior species when both occupy the
                  same site. This hierarchical model of performance
                  trade-offs, however, exhibits some unusual behaviors
                  in the high-diversity limit, including
                  infinitesimally close species packing,
                  pathologically slow dynamics, and fundamentally
                  important regularities in trait-abundance
                  relationships. In particular, under the condition of
                  constant mortality across species, a 3/2-power-law
                  relationship emerges between abundance and fecundity
                  under infinite packing (abundance of a species with
                  fecundity f is inversely proportional to f to the
                  3/2 power). In this article, we explore the
                  high-diversity limit of the hierarchical
                  competition-colonization model, with particular
                  emphasis on patterns of species packing,
                  species-abundance relationships, and system
                  stability. Because of the potential for
                  pathologically slow dynamics following perturbations
                  and infinitesimally close species packing in the
                  high-diversity limit for this class of models, the
                  models may need to be modified to include more
                  realistic mechanisms governing the extent and timing
                  of interspecific competitive exclusion in order to
                  effectively capture the structure and dynamics of

  abstract =     {In so far as it is associated with declining
                  fertility and increasing mortality, senescence is
                  directly detrimental to reproductive
                  success. Natural selection should therefore act in
                  the direction of postponing or eliminating
                  senescence from the life history. The widespread
                  occurrence of senescence is explained by observing
                  that (i) the force of natural selection is generally
                  weaker at late ages than at early ages, and (ii) the
                  acquisition of greater longevity usually involves
                  some cost. Two convergent theories are the
                  'antagonistic pleiotropy' theory, based in
                  population genetics, and the 'disposable soma'
                  theory, based in physiological ecology. The
                  antagonistic pleiotropy theory proposes that certain
                  alleles that are favoured because of beneficial
                  early effects also have deleterious later
                  effects. The disposable soma theory suggests that
                  because of the competing demands of reproduction
                  less effort is invested in the maintenance of
                  somatic tissues than is necessary for indefinite
                  survival.},

                  ecological functions is one of the most common
                  explanations for coexistence in communities. Despite
                  the potential for species coexistence occurring at
                  local or regional spatial scales, trade-offs are
                  typically approached at a single scale. In recent
                  years, ecologists have increasingly provided
                  evidence for the importance of community processes
                  at both local and regional spatial scales. This
                  review summarizes the theoretical predictions for
                  the traits associated with trade-offs under
                  different conditions and at different spatial
                  scales. We provide a spatial framework for
                  understanding trade-offs, coexistence and the
                  supportive empirical evidence. Predictions are
                  presented that link the patterns of diversity
                  observed to the patterns of trade-offs that lead to
                  coexistence at different spatial scales. Recent
                  evidence for the evolution of trade-offs under
                  different conditions is provided which explores both
                  laboratory microcosm studies and phylogenetic
                  tests. Examining trade-offs within a spatial
                  framework can provide a strong approach to

                  variation in PT is associated with inducible small

                  and genetic divergence. We found little evidence for

                  measurements revealed significant plasticity for PT,

                  tended to have smaller leaves both in the CE and in

                  repeated evolutionary divergences and are perhaps
                  convergent adaptations for species radiating into

                  along the cool coastal bluffs of southern North
                  America. Both species exhibit peak sHsp accumulation
                  at 42degreesC. Encelia californica accumulated
                  greater levels of sHsp at temperatures below

                  levels of sHsp while maintaining photosynthetic

                  levels of sHsp and F-v/F-m declined in parallel to

                  maintained greater F-v/F-m at all time points. Our

                  distance of .apprx. 2 km in the Front Range of the
                  Rocky Mountains in Colorado USA. Each population was
                  further divided into 5 subpopulations. Four isozymes
                  were electrophoretically resolved from needle tissue
                  removed from each tree. Statistic characterizing the

  abstract =     {Some species of coastal sage and chaparral shrubs of
                  California are extremely tolerant of tissue
                  dehydration, surviving water potentials as low as -9
                  MPa during dry summer months. Such low water
                  potentials (high tensions on xylem water) are known
                  to cause severe embolism formation in the xylem
                  vessels of woody plants, blocking water transport
                  and potentially causing shoot dieback. Thus drought
                  hardy species of coastal sage and chaparral are
                  either extremely resistant to water stress-induced
                  embolism or they become severely embolized during
                  summer drought. We compared the seasonal changes in
                  xylem water potential and xylem embolism (percent
                  loss in hydraulic conductivity of stem segments due
                  to air emboli) between co-occurring Salvia mellifera
                  (coastal sage) and Ceanothus megacarpus (chaparral)
                  growing in the Santa Monica Mountains of southern
                  California. We also determined the relative
                  sensitivity of each species to water stress-induced
                  embolism by artificially dehydrating branches and
                  measuring percent loss in hydraulic conductivity of
                  xylem tissues at a given water potential. We found
                  that both species experienced the same minimum in
                  seasonal water potentials (-8 MPa) but the xylem of
                  S. mellifera lost 78% in hydraulic conductivity
                  whereas the xylem of C. megacarpus lost only 17% in
                  hydraulic conductivity. These values for a natural
                  plant community were within 10% of those predicted
                  by our artificial dehydration curves. Our estimate
                  of susceptibility to water stress-induced embolism
                  indicated that 50% loss in hydraulic conductivity
                  would occur at -4.5 MPa for S. mellifera but at -11
                  MPa for C. megacarpus. Irrigation of S. mellifera
                  for one summer reduced loss in conductivity from 78
                  to 38% and increased leaf areas 10-fold, indicating
                  that xylem embolism and leaf drop were drought
                  induced. Our results show that xylem tissues of
                  S. mellifera are more sensitive to water stress and
                  tissue dehydration than those of co-occurring
                  C. megacarpus. The observed ability of S. mellifera
                  to inhabit drier sites than C. megacarpus may result
                  from drought deciduousness in summer and high growth
                  rates in spring that facilitate rapid construction

                  systems of trees. In order to quantify the hydraulic
                  impact of cavitation in such systems, existing
                  techniques have been modified. Branched shoot or
                  root systems were prepared for measurement by
                  removal of leaves, or root tips, respectively. The
                  shoot or root system was enclosed in a vacuum
                  chamber with the proximal end protruding and
                  supplied with perfusing solution. Flow through the
                  xylem was induced by chamber vacuum. Hydraulic
                  conductance was determined from the slope of the
                  flow rate versus pressure relationship. Xylem
                  embolism was quantified from the increase in
                  hydraulic conductance following high pressure (100
                  kPa) perfusion of solution through the
                  plant. Examples are provided of the application of

                  water potential were monitored on foliage of burned
                  and nonburned regeneration of northern red oak
                  (Quercus rubra L.), white ash (Fraxinus americana
                  L.), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.)
                  following spring fires in 1989 and 1990. Fire led to
                  a stimulation of light-saturated photosynthesis in
                  foliage of resprouting plants, but the effect varied
                  in magnitude among species. On average,
                  photosynthesis of post-fire maple was 42% higher
                  than that on nonburned plots, with corresponding
                  increases occurring in stomatal conductance and leaf
                  N concentration, Ln general, fire had a marginal
                  effect on leaf properties of oak and ash. In 1990,
                  the ratio of root area to leaf area and the water
                  potential of sunlit foliage were significantly
                  higher on burned than nonburned plots for maple, but
                  not for oak or ash, paralleling trends in
                  photosynthesis. There was little evidence of a
                  treatment difference in soil moisture or nitrogen
                  availability, and it appeared that fire-induced
                  stimulations in photosynthesis were mediated
                  primarily by changes in intrinsic (e.g., root
                  area/leaf area ratio) as opposed to extrinsic (e.g.,
                  soil moisture) factors governing resource

                  such alterable sources of natural selection in
                  environments; We call these processes niche
                  construction. We explore the evolutionary
                  consequences of niche construction using a
                  true-locus population genetic model, which extends
                  earlier analyses by allowing resource distributions
                  to be influenced both by niche construction and by
                  independent processes of renewal and depletion. The
                  analysis confirms that niche construction can be a
                  potent evolutionary agent by generating selection
                  that leads to the fixation of otherwise deleterious
                  alleles, supporting stable polymorphisms where none

                  stable polymorphisms, and generating unusual

                  construction, or niche construction that only weakly

                  in xylem can block water transport (gas embolism),
                  leading to shoot dieback, Two environmental factors
                  that cause gas embolism formation in xylem conduits
                  are drought and freezing air temperatures, We
                  compared the differential vulnerabilities of Rhus
                  laurina and Ceanothus megacarpus, co-dominant shrub
                  species in the coastal regions of the Santa Monica
                  Mountains of southern California, to both water
                  stress-induced and freezing-induced embolism of
                  their xylem, Rhus laurina has relatively large xylem
                  vessel diameters, a deep root system, and a large
                  basal burl from which it vigorously resprouts after
                  wildfire or freezing injury, In contrast, Ceanothus
                  megacarpus has small-diameter vessels, a shallow
                  root system, no basal burl and is a non-sprouter
                  after shoot removal by wildfire, We found that R,
                  laurina became 50% embolized at a water stress of -3
                  MPa and 100% embolized by a freeze-thaw cycle at all
                  hydration levels, In contrast, C, megacarpus became
                  50% embolized at a water stress of -9 MPa and 100%
                  embolized by freeze-thaw events only at water
                  potentials lower than -3 MPa, Reducing thaw rates
                  from 0.8 degrees C min(-1) to 0.08 degrees C min(-1)
                  (the normal thaw rate measured in situ) had no
                  effect on embolism formation in R, laurina but

                  well-hydrated C, megacarpus (embolism reduced from

                  theory of gas bubble formation and dissolution in

                  in xylem can block water transport (gas embolism),
                  leading to shoot dieback, Two environmental factors
                  that cause gas embolism formation in xylem conduits
                  are drought and freezing air temperatures, We
                  compared the differential vulnerabilities of Rhus
                  laurina and Ceanothus megacarpus, co-dominant shrub
                  species in the coastal regions of the Santa Monica

                  vessel diameters, a deep root system, and a large
                  basal burl from which it vigorously resprouts after
                  wildfire or freezing injury, In contrast, Ceanothus
                  megacarpus has small-diameter vessels, a shallow
                  root system, no basal burl and is a non-sprouter
                  after shoot removal by wildfire, We found that R,
                  laurina became 50% embolized at a water stress of -3
                  MPa and 100% embolized by a freeze-thaw cycle at all
                  hydration levels, In contrast, C, megacarpus became
                  50% embolized at a water stress of -9 MPa and 100%
                  embolized by freeze-thaw events only at water
                  potentials lower than -3 MPa, Reducing thaw rates
                  from 0.8 degrees C min(-1) to 0.08 degrees C min(-1)
                  (the normal thaw rate measured in situ) had no
                  effect on embolism formation in R, laurina but
                  significantly reduced embolism occurrence in
                  well-hydrated C, megacarpus (embolism reduced from
                  74 to 35%), These results were consistent with the
                  theory of gas bubble formation and dissolution in
                  xylem sap, They also agree with field observations
                  of differential shoot dieback in these two species

  abstract =     { Summary Pinus sabiniana Dougl. (grey pine) forms
                  savanna forests in the foothills surrounding
                  California's Great Central Valley. However, its
                  fossil record, which dates from the late Miocene
                  through the Pliocene and Pleistocene, is found
                  exclusively in southern California, south of the
                  species' present range. A total of twenty-nine
                  isozyme loci, representing eighteen enzyme systems,
                  was assayed to analyse the genetic structure in
                  eight populations of grey pine and attempt to track
                  its migration history from southern to northern
                  California. Expected heterozygosity in the two
                  southernmost samples was 0.128 and 0.150, and
                  heterozygosity tended to decrease with increasing
                  latitude, suggesting the loss of diversity as grey
                  pine dispersed northward. However, genetic distances
                  between populations were very small, even on
                  opposite sides of the treeless Great Central Valley;
                  and estimated time since divergence was 900 to 9000
                  years at a maximum. Wright's FST, the proportion of
                  total genetic diversity among populations, was only
                  0.057, which is similar to values found in many
                  conifers with continuous distributions. Nm, the
                  number of migrants among populations per generation,
                  was 4.1 to 6.7, depending on estimator, and
                  indicates that gene flow is extensive, or was so in
                  the recent past. In every population, observed
                  heterozygosity was less than expected
                  heterozygosity, and the fixation index, FIS, for the
                  progeny was 0.128, which indicates a fairly high
                  rate of inbreeding. The genetic similarity of
                  disjunct populations, in combination with
                  paleogeographic and paleoclimatic evidence, suggests
                  that grey pine formed a continuous population
                  throughout the Great Central Valley, perhaps between
                  12,000 and 8000 yrs BP. Its range became fragmented
                  during the Xerothermic, when it ascended into the
                  foothills. Gaps in its range correlate with late
                  Pleistocene-early Holocene lakes in adjacent basins
                  and with the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. }

                  conducted to construct the evolutionary history and
                  evaluate the historical classifications of Prunus
                  and the Amygdaloideae. The analyses suggest two
                  major groups within the Amygdaloideae: (1) Prunus
                  s.l. (sensu lato) and Maddenia, and (2) Exochorda,

                  (formerly in the Spiraeoideae) in the
                  Amygdaloideae. Maddenia is found to be nested within

                  but basal to Prunus s.l. in the maximum likelihood
                  analysis. Within Prunus, two major groups are
                  recognizable: (1) the Amygdalus-Prunus group, and
                  (2) the Cerasus-Laurocerasus-Padus group. The clades
                  in the ITS phylogeny are not congruent with most
                  subgeneric groups in the widely used classification
                  of Prunus by Rehder. A broadly defined Prunus is

                  scales in ecology. Here we review current
                  understanding about this concept. We first
                  investigate issues related to its definition as a
                  set of local communities that are linked by
                  dispersal of multiple potentially interacting
                  species. We then identify four paradigms for
                  metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the
                  species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the
                  neutral view, that each emphasizes different
                  processes of potential importance in
                  metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct
                  intellectual histories and we discuss elements
                  related to their potential future synthesis. We then
                  use this framework to discuss why the concept is
                  useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and
                  illustrate this with a number of both theoretical
                  and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to
                  understand increasingly complex mechanisms and
                  strive to work across multiple scales of
                  spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the
                  metacommunity can provide important insights that
                  frequently contrast with those that would be

                  associated. However. inconsistent patterns have
                  emerged from these studies. with varying mechanisms
                  proposed to explain emergent relationships, We
                  employ a theoretical framework. based on key theory
                  lineages of vegetation dynamics and species
                  coexistence, to examine relationships between
                  species abundance and seed size. From these theory
                  lineages, we identified four models and their
                  predictions: the Seed size number trade-off model
                  (SSNTM). the Succession model (SM), the Spatial
                  competition model (SCM). and the Lottery model
                  (LM). We then explored empirical evidence from ten
                  diverse plant communities for seed size and
                  abundance patterns. and related these patterns to
                  model predictions. The SSNTM predicts a negative
                  correlation between seed size and abundance, The SM
                  predicts either a negative, positive or no
                  correlation dependent on time since
                  disturbance. while the SCM and LM make no
                  predictions for a relationship between seed size and
                  abundance. We found no evidence for consistent
                  relationships between seed size and abundance across
                  the ten communities. There were no consistent
                  differences in seed size and abundance relationships
                  between communities dominated by annuals compared to
                  perennials. In three of the ten communities a
                  significant positive seed size and abundance
                  correlation emerged. which falsified the SSNTM as an
                  important determinant of abundance structure in
                  these communities. For sites in coastal
                  woodland. the relationships between seed size and
                  abundance were consistent with the predictions of
                  the SM (although generally not significant), with
                  fire being the disturbance. We suggest that the
                  significant positive seed size and abundance
                  correlations found may be driven by the association
                  between large seeds and large growth forms., as
                  large growth forms tend to be dominant. It seems
                  likely that patterns of seed size and abundance in
                  communities are determined by a complex interaction
                  between environmental factors and correlations of

  abstract =     {This paper examines four key mechanisms of the seed
                  size/number trade-off (SSNT) models to assess their
                  relevance to a general understanding of plant
                  community structure. Mechanism 1 is that large seeds
                  have a greater probability of winning in competition
                  against smaller seeds. I provide interspecific
                  experimental evidence that there is a competitive
                  hierarchy among seedlings based on seed
                  size. Mechanism 2 is that a trade-off exists between
                  the number and size of seeds produced for a given
                  reproductive allocation. Negative correlations
                  between seed size and number were found consistently
                  across a range of species from a range of habitats,
                  from published literature. Mechanism 3, that
                  seedling-seedling competition is an important
                  influence on species composition, was found to exist
                  potentially in a range of environments, including
                  annual-dominated, post-fire and gap-dynamic
                  communities. However, there is little quantitative
                  evidence available and this is likely to be a
                  restrictive mechanism. Mechanism 4, that small seeds
                  are superior colonists due to their greater number,
                  was tested in a field experiment in a calcareous
                  grassland community. No supporting evidence was
                  found, suggesting that the SSNT is not an important
                  determinant of structure in this community. Thus two
                  of the four mechanisms can be considered to hold
                  true generally, while the third mechanism may be
                  valid in particular environments. The fourth
                  mechanism did not apply in the community tested, but
                  could be tested in a wider range of communities.},

                  identification of evolutionary
                  processes. Specifically, it has been proposed that
                  new comparative methods can distinguish the direct
                  effects of natural selection on the distribution of
                  a trait within a clade from the effects of drift,
                  indirect selection, genotype-by-environment
                  interaction, and uncontrolled environmental
                  variation. Such methods can supposedly unravel the
                  relative importance of these factors by the
                  phylogenetic analysis of traits, performance
                  attributes, and habitats. We argue that they
                  cannot. We show that many different evolutionary
                  mechanisms can, in principle, account for any one
                  interspecific pattern, and we illustrate our case
                  using examples from the comparative literature. We
                  argue that these confounded mechanisms can only be
                  unraveled if patterns of selection or genetic
                  variation and covariation are directly measured in
                  many species within a clade. Even though comparative
                  methods are valuable for examining the evolutionary
                  history of traits, they will often mislead in the

                  the validity of this notion, we evaluated
                  theoretical and empirical work linking dispersal
                  kernels to the relative abundance, distribution,
                  dispersion, and coexistence of species. We found
                  considerable theoretical evidence that seed
                  dispersal affects species coexistence by slowing
                  down exclusion through local dispersal and a
                  competition-dispersal trade-off, yet empirical
                  support was scant. Instead, most empirical
                  investigations examined how dispersal affects
                  species distribution and dispersion, subjects with
                  little theory. This work also relied heavily on
                  dispersal proxies and correlational analyses of
                  community patterns, methods unable to exclude
                  alternative hypotheses. Owing to the overall
                  dichotomy between theory and empirical results, we
                  argue that the importance of dispersal cannot be
                  taken for granted. We conclude by advocating
                  experiments that manipulate the seed dispersal
                  pattern, and models that incorporate empirically
                  documented dispersal kernels. },

                  hydrologic and microbial processes that control
                  carbon ( C) and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical
                  processes in chaparral ecosystems. These
                  biogeochemical processes in turn determine N cycling
                  under chronic N deposition. In order to examine
                  connections between climate and N dynamics, we
                  quantified decadal-scale water, C and N states and
                  fluxes at annual, monthly and daily time steps for a
                  California chaparral ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada
                  using the DAYCENT model. The daily output
                  simulations of net mineralization, stream flow and
                  stream nitrate (NO3-) export were developed for
                  DAYCENT in order to simulate the N dynamics most
                  appropriate for the abrupt rewetting events
                  characteristic of Mediterranean chaparral
                  ecosystems. Overall, the magnitude of annual modeled
                  net N mineralization, soil and plant biomass C and
                  N, nitrate export and gaseous N emission agreed with
                  those of observations. Gaseous N emission was a
                  major N loss pathway in chaparral ecosystems, in
                  which nitric oxide ( NO) is the dominant
                  species. The modeled C and N fluxes of net primary
                  production (NPP), N uptake and N mineralization,
                  NO3- export and gaseous N emission showed both high
                  inter-annual and intraannual variability. Our
                  simulations also showed dramatic fire effects on
                  NPP, N uptake, N mineralization and gaseous N
                  emission for three years of post. re. The decease in
                  simulated soil organic C and N storages was not
                  dramatic, but lasted a longer time. For the seasonal
                  pattern, the predicted C and N. uxes were greatest
                  during December to March, and lowest in the
                  summer. The model predictions suggested that an
                  increase in the N deposition rate would increase N
                  losses through gaseous N emission and stream N
                  export in the chaparral ecosystems of the Sierra
                  Nevada due to changes in N saturation status. The
                  model predictions could not capture stream NO3-
                  export during most rewetting events suggesting that
                  a dry-rewetting mechanism representing the increase
                  in N mineralization following soil wetting needs to
                  be incorporated into biogeochemical models of
                  semi-arid ecosystems.},

                  morphological, and Aoristic similarity to
                  Mediterranean-type vegetation and is considered a
                  relict of the Madro-Tertiary Geoflora under a
                  non-Mediterranean climate. This vegetation provides
                  an ideal scenario to test the role of fire in
                  Mediterranean ecosystems because historical fire
                  occurrence is absent and the species assembly is
                  constituted mostly by Madro-Tertiary elements and
                  Neotropical species (some of them, endemic species
                  from Mexico). The existence of congeneric species of
                  the California chaparral allows us to determine the
                  regeneration ability of these communities after fire
                  in relation to resprouting and seeding strategies,
                  which are widespread modes reported in the
                  Mediterranean-type vegetation. By the experimental
                  application of fire in the two biogeographical
                  groups of species, we tested the hypothesis that low
                  resprouting ability of California congeneric species
                  (Madro-Tertiary species) after fire would indicate
                  that fire has played an important selective force in
                  the resprouting habit. A low resprouting ability in
                  the Neotropical group of species would suggest that
                  fire has molded the set of species dominating
                  fire-prone environments. Our results indicated that
                  resprouting is a widespread trait in the mexical
                  species characterized by the presence of lignotubers
                  and burls. Resprouting can be considered an ancient
                  trait, probably linked to losses of aboveground
                  biomass, that became a pre-adaptation
                  in;Mediterranean fire-prone communities. The
                  Neotropical group of species showed less ability to
                  regenerate after fire. and small plants were more
                  likely to die after disturbance in this group than
                  in the Madro-Tertiary group. The resprouting feature
                  and the seeder strategy of other species after a
                  fire in the mexical shrubland are similar to
                  Mediterranean-type ecosystems, emphasizing their
                  common origin and the relevance of phylogenetic and

                  latifolia L., and Viburnum tinus L., with 88, 86 and
                  83% survival respectively; these groups had
                  resprouts emerging from rootcrowns. Then followed
                  Arbutus unedo L. (75%), Pistacia lentiscus L. (73%),
                  Erica arborea L. (77%), Erica multiflora L. (57%)
                  and Juniperus oxycedrus L. (55%). This last group
                  had resprouts from lignotubers or burls. These two
                  groups also differed in the variability around the
                  mean: the first showed a lower coefficient of
                  variation, 6-12, and the second ranged from 19 to
                  26. Slope exposure had no significant influence on
                  the process of resprouting, but soil depth did, with
                  precipitation as a covariate. In the shallow soil
                  category, the difference in genet survival between
                  southern and northern exposures was 14% (71%
                  vs. 57%); while the difference in the deep soil
                  category was low, 5% (87% vs. 82%). There was no
                  significant interaction. The component of variance
                  for soils was larger than that for species-specific
                  effects; substantial overlap of the within-species
                  variance indicated that species responded as if they
                  were a single hypothetical population, in which most
                  of the variation in chances of survival was due to
                  the soil conditions. The possession of the
                  resprouting habit did not ensure a high
                  performance. Hence, we find weak support for fire as
                  a factor in the evolution of the resprouting habit.},

                  diversity in communities governed by competition for
                  space has been a longstanding problem in ecology We
                  present a simple theoretical model to explore the
                  influence of immigration from an external source on
                  local coexistence, species abundance patterns, and
                  ecosystem processes in plant communities. The model
                  is built after classical metapopulation models but
                  is applied to competition fog space between
                  individuals and includes immigration by a propagule
                  rain and an extinction threshold for rare
                  species. Our model shows that immigration can have a
                  huge effect on local species diversity in
                  competitive communities where competition for space
                  would lead to the exclusion of all but one species
                  if the community were closed. Local species richness
                  is expected to increase strongly when immigration
                  intensity increases beyond the threshold required
                  for the successful establishment of one or a few
                  individuals. Community structure and species
                  relative abundances are also expected to change
                  markedly with immigration intensity. Increasing
                  immigration causes total space occupation by the
                  community to increase but primary productivity on
                  average to either decrease or stay constant with
                  increasing diversity, depending on the relation
                  between immigration and local reproduction
                  rates. These results stress the need for a regional
                  perspective to understand the processes that
                  determine species diversity, species abundance
                  patterns, and ecosystem functioning in local
                  communities.},

                  in the southwestern Cape, South Africa, but are
                  distinct in terms of species composition and
                  community processes. Fires occur frequently in
                  fynbos communities, but seldom in the forest
                  communities, which are usually restricted lo
                  sheltered ravines or stream banks. Forest species
                  establish in fynbos between fires, and may
                  predominate eventually in exceptional
                  circumstances. We proposed a conceptual model for
                  the development of forest in fynbos and examined
                  processes in the model related to nucleation and the
                  establishment of forest species. Germination and
                  establishment requirements of forest and fynbos
                  species were examined to determine causes of
                  community distinctness. Nuclei of forest species
                  dominated by fruiting species had more seedlings of
                  forest species and more species than nuclei
                  dominated by non-fruiting species. Reciprocal
                  sowings showed that forest and fynbos species have
                  similar germination requirements, but the seedlings
                  establish in their appropriate communities
                  only. Germination studies demonstrated that soil
                  moisture is not the only factor limiting
                  establishment of forest species, and that enhanced
                  soil nutrient levels, litter and a canopy of
                  vegetation influence seedling survival even in wet
                  conditions. Field studies, to characterize the
                  habitats in fynbos vegetation in which forest
                  seedlings are able to become established, showed
                  forest seedlings 10 be associated with a tall herb
                  layer and vegetation cover greater than
                  50%. Seedlings were invariably under or within 1 m
                  of a perch, which could be a fruiting forest species
                  or a fynbos shrub. Recruitment of fynbos species is
                  coupled with disturbance whereas recruitment of
                  forest species in fynbos is associated with
                  nucleation and habitat amelioration, and occurs in
                  the absence of fires. The lack of coupling of
                  recruitment of forest species with disturbance
                  results in the exclusion of forest from most areas
                  of the fire-prone fynbos biome.},

                  are rare, prompted the development of species
                  abundance models(1-3). Nevertheless, despite the
                  large literature on the commonness and rarity of
                  species inspired by these pioneering studies, some
                  widespread empirical patterns of species abundance
                  resist easy explanation(4). Notable among these is
                  the observation(5) that in large assemblages there
                  are more rare species than the log normal model

                  habitats, are log normally distributed. Occasional

  abstract =     {This article considers the statistical issues
                  relevant to the comparative method in evolutionary
                  biology. A generalized Linear model (GLM) is
                  presented for the analysis of comparative data,
                  which can be used to address questions regarding the
                  relationship between traits or between traits and
                  environments, the rate of phenotypic evolution, the
                  degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral
                  state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes
                  the similarity among evolutionary questions asked in
                  comparative studies. We then discuss ways of
                  specifying the sources of error involved in a
                  comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error
                  due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to
                  misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the
                  impact of these sources of error can be taken into
                  account in a comparative analysis. In contrast to
                  most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our
                  procedure offers substantial flexibility in the
                  choice of microevolutionary assumptions underlying
                  the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to
                  choose assumptions that are most appropriate for
                  their particular set of data and evolutionary
                  question. In developing the approach, we also
                  propose novel ways of incorporating within-species
                  variation and/or measurement error into phylogenetic
                  analyses, of estimating ancestral states, and of
                  considering both continuous (quantitative) and
                  categorical (qualitative or ''state'') characters in
                  the same analysis.},

                  little is known about their capacity to sustain
                  plant functional diversity. Most
                  conservation-orientated studies of such landscapes
                  focus on species diversity, whereas less attention
                  is given to functional traits and their
                  conservation. We examine the functional diversity of
                  herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in three
                  forest habitats (understorey, tree-fall gaps and
                  riverbanks) and three deforested habitats (pasture,
                  roadside vegetation and pasture riverbanks), each
                  replicated in three human-dominated landscapes in
                  southern Costa Rica. We focus on six categorical
                  traits related to forest regeneration, reproduction
                  and dispersal: pollination mechanism, dispersal
                  mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and
                  seed size. We compared trait state richness and
                  composition of each trait in forested and deforested
                  habitats and how three pollination states (bat, bird
                  and bee pollination) and three dispersal states
                  (fur, bird and monkey dispersal) of conservation
                  interest were distributed across these
                  landscapes. Only one trait state was missing from
                  forest, and none was missing from deforested
                  habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently
                  trait state poor. Forested and deforested plots
                  differed in trait state composition for all
                  traits. Pasture riverbanks and road verges were
                  compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and
                  tree-fall gaps, for multiple traits. There were more
                  compositional similarities between forested and
                  deforested habitat types when abundance of
                  individuals with a trait state was used as the basis
                  for similarity measures than when the number of
                  species with each trait state was used. Bat-, bird-
                  and bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and
                  monkey-dispersed fruits were most common in forest
                  and pasture riverbanks whereas species with
                  fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all
                  deforested habitats. Functional diversity patterns
                  were inconsistent across habitat types and locations
                  but overall functional similarity was high between
                  forested and deforested communities. Patterns of
                  functional diversity were far more variable between
                  habitats and landscapes than the consistent patterns
                  found previously for species diversity.},

                  the relationship between species and functional
                  diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant
                  communities in forested and deforested habitats in

                  growth form, fruit type, fruit size, and seed
                  size. We ask: (1) What is the relationship between
                  species richness and functional diversity (trait
                  state richness)? (2) Do species/functional diversity
                  relationships differ between forested and deforested
                  habitats? and (3) Are observed species/functional
                  diversity patterns more consistent with ecological
                  filtering or differentiation-based assembly
                  processes? We show that species richness is often a
                  weak surrogate for functional diversity, depending
                  on the trait. Species/functional diversity
                  relationships differ significantly between forested
                  and deforested habitats, but the nature
                  of-differences is trait dependent. Dispersal
                  mechanism and fruit type number increased more
                  rapidly in deforested than forested habitats, but
                  the opposite was true for most other traits. Using a
                  null model, we found evidence of ecological
                  filtering for most traits in both habitats. Results
                  demonstrate that deforested habitats do not
                  necessarily contain lower functional diversity than
                  forest but that the ecological assembly processes
                  influencing community function in deforested
                  communities differ dramatically from forest.},

                  population growth is limited by seed production. We
                  studied two non-sprouting Protea species, both
                  entirely dependent on seeds for recruitment after
                  fire, to determine how flower harvesting would
                  affect the size of the next generation after
                  burning. Five harvesting treatments (0, 25, 50, 75
                  and 100% inflorescence removal) were applied, each
                  replicated four times in 10 times 10 m
                  plots. Seedbanks were censused before a late-summer
                  burn for each species and each replicate. The mean
                  proportion of seeds surviving the burn until
                  germination the following spring was 0.46 for Protea
                  repens and 0.57 for Protea neriifolia. Of the
                  seedlings that emerged, 90% and 55%, respectively,
                  survived the first summer drought. Flower production
                  in the 9 year old stand was strongly related to
                  population density. Optimal plant densities for
                  maximum flower production were estimated as 150 for
                  P. repens and 70 for P. neriifolia. These target
                  densities were greatly exceeded by seedling
                  populations surviving the first summer drought in
                  unharvested stands. If future density-independent
                  mortality is negligible, the excess represents that
                  part of the seedbank that could have been harvested
                  before the burn without influencing future flower
                  production. We developed a simple static model for
                  setting flower harvesting levels in these
                  seed-saturated populations. The predicted harvesting
                  levels (50% of inflorescences in P. repens and 85%
                  in P. neriifolia) were validated against the
                  experimental harvests. We discuss the sensitivity of
                  harvesting levels to variation in fecundity/density
                  relationships, seed survival through a burn and
                  seedling survival until flowering, and the

                  ornata was developed, using stochastic dynamic
                  programming (a state-dependent decision-making
                  tool), to determine optimal fire management
                  strategies that incorporate trade-offs between
                  biodiversity conservation and fuel reduction. 2. The
                  modelled population of B. ornata was described by
                  its age and density, and was exposed to the risk of
                  unplanned fires and stochastic variation in
                  germination success. 3. For a given population in
                  each year, three management strategies were
                  considered: (i) lighting a prescribed fire; (ii)
                  controlling the incidence of unplanned fire; (iii)
                  doing nothing. 4. The optimal management strategy
                  depended on the state of the B. ornata population,
                  with the time since the last fire (age of the
                  population) being the most important
                  variable. Lighting a prescribed fire at an age of
                  less than 30 years was only optimal when the density
                  of seedlings after a fire was low (< 100 plants
                  ha(-1)) or when there were benefits of maintaining a
                  low fuel load by using more frequent
                  fire. 5. Because the cost of management was assumed
                  to be negligible (relative to the value of the
                  persistence of the population), the do-nothing
                  option was never the optimal strategy, although
                  lighting prescribed fires had only marginal benefits
                  when the mean interval between unplanned fires was
                  less than 20-30 years.},

  abstract =     {Land use practices since European settlement have
                  had profound effects on the composition and
                  structure of certain forested ecosystems in the
                  southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain. One significant
                  change since the turn of the century has been the
                  invasion of upland pine forests by sand pine in the
                  state of Florida panhandle and peninsula. This study
                  quantified sand pine extent and expansion and
                  examined links between sand pine distribution and
                  environmental factors in the Florida
                  panhandle. Geographic information system analysis
                  using aerial photographs (1949 and 1994) showed sand
                  pine expansion and also increased canopy cover of
                  sand pine over time. There was a high rate of
                  conversion of longleaf pine to sand pine from 1949
                  to 1994 (44%), and conversion of sparse sand pine
                  stands to dense sand pine stands (69%). Therefore,
                  widespread changes in the Florida landscape were
                  evident during a relatively short time
                  period. Adjacency analyses showed a strong negative
                  association between longleaf pine and dense sand
                  pine and a positive association between riparian
                  vegetation and dense sand pine. Distribution of sand
                  pine across elevation demonstrated that sand pine
                  expanded inland and upland into longleaf-pine
                  forests. In 1949, sand pine was selectively located
                  on sites below 30 m in elevations; by 1994, sparse
                  and moderately dense sand-pine stands were found at
                  all elevations. Thus, any area that may receive an
                  input of sand pine seeds, most notably from riparian
                  areas, is vulnerable to establishment.},

                  and dynamics reveal that many large-scale features
                  of community structure (such as species-rank
                  distributions and species-area relations) can be
                  explained by a so-called neutral model. Using this
                  approach, species are taken to be equivalent and
                  trophic relations are not taken into account
                  explicitly. Here we provide a general analytic
                  solution to the local community model of Hubbell's
                  neutral theory of biodiversity by recasting it as an
                  urn model, i.e. a Markovian description of states
                  and their transitions. Both stationary and
                  time-dependent distributions are analysed. The
                  stationary distribution-also called the zero-sum
                  multinomial-is given in closed form. An approximate
                  form for the time-dependence is obtained by using an
                  expansion of the master equation. The temporal
                  evolution of the approximate distribution is shown
                  to be a good representation for the true temporal
                  evolution for a large range of parameter values. (C)

  abstract =     {Using a simple two-patch model, we examine how
                  patterns of spatial and temporal variation in
                  carrying capacities affect natural selection on
                  dispersal. The size of the population in each patch
                  is regulated separately, according to a
                  discrete-generation logistic equation, and
                  individuals disperse from each patch at propensities
                  determined by their genotype. We consider genotypes
                  that express the same dispersal propensities in both
                  patches and genotypes that express patch-specific
                  disperal propensities. Contrary to previous
                  analyses, our results show that some level of
                  dispersal is favored by selection under almost all
                  regimes of habitat variability, including a
                  spatially varying and temporally constant
                  environment. Furthermore, two very different
                  polymorphisms are favored under different
                  conditions. When carrying capacities vary spatially
                  but not temporally, any number of genotypes with
                  patch-specific dispersal propensities in ratios
                  inversely proportional to the ratio of the carrying
                  capacities can coexist. This result extends previous
                  analyses to show that dispersal is favored in such
                  an environment if individuals can alter dispersal
                  propensities in response to environmental cues. In
                  contrast, when carrying capacities vary both
                  spatially and temporally but differ in mean or
                  variance, a polymorphism of only two genotypes (a
                  high-dispersal and a no-dispersal genotype) is
                  favored when the only genotypes possible are ones
                  expressing the same dispersal propensity in both
                  patches. However, this dimorphism can be invaded and
                  replaced by one genotype with a particular
                  combination of patch-specific dispersal propensities
                  in a ratio also inversely proportional to the ratio
                  of the average population sizes. We discuss a number
                  of testable predictions this model suggests about
                  the amounts of phenotypic and genetic variation in
                  dispersal characters that are expected both within
                  and between populations, and the degree to which the
                  expression of phenotypic characters affecting
                  dispersal propensity should be sensitive to
                  environmental conditions. The model also suggests
                  novel mechanisms for coexistence between competing
                  species in varying environment.},

                  correlations due to the common ancestry of
                  species. The method of evolutionary contrasts
                  removes such correlations by estimating the amount
                  of character change between pairs of closely related
                  species that has occurred since their most recent
                  common ancestors. The original method allows
                  character change to be estimated only along pairs of
                  branches on a phylogeny, but many hypotheses address
                  change along single branches. In this article the
                  method of evolutionary contrasts is extended to
                  allow character change along a set of single
                  branches on a phylogeny to be estimated, expected

                  extensions also result in a set of contrasts that
                  are not correlated because of common ancestry. These
                  extensions will allow hypotheses to be tested
                  concerning character change associated with host or
                  habitat shifts, changes in breeding system (e.g.,
                  monogamy vs. polygyny, monoecy vs. dioecy), changes
                  in life history (e.g., semelparity vs. iteroparity),

                  the abundance of 12 chaparral shrub and tree species
                  in three watersheds of the Santa Ynez Mountains,
                  California. The species response models are driven
                  by five variables: average annual soil moisture,
                  seasonal variability in soil moisture, average
                  annual photosynthetically active radiation, maximum
                  air temperature over the dry season (May-October),
                  and substrate rockiness. The energy and moisture
                  variables are derived by integrating high resolution
                  (10 m) digital terrain data and daily climate
                  observations with a process-based hydro-ecological
                  model (RHESSys). Field-sampled data on species
                  abundance are spatially integrated with the
                  distributed environmental variables for developing
                  and evaluating the species response models. The
                  species considered are differentially distributed
                  along topographically-mediated environmental
                  gradients in ways that are consistent with known
                  ecophysiological processes. Spatial patterns in
                  shrub abundance are most strongly associated with
                  annual soil moisture and solar radiation. Substrate
                  rockiness is also closely associated with the
                  establishment of certain species, such as Adenostoma
                  fasciculatum and Arctostaphylos glauca. In general,
                  species that depend on fire for seedling recruitment
                  (e.g., Ceanothous megacarpus) occur at high
                  abundance in xeric environments, whereas species
                  that do not depend on fire (e.g., Heteromeles
                  arbutifolia) occur at higher abundance in mesic
                  environments. Model performance varies between
                  species and is related to life history strategies
                  for regeneration. The scale of our analysis may be
                  less effective at capturing the processes that
                  underlie the establishment of species that do not
                  depend on fire for recruitment. Analysis of
                  predication errors in relation to environmental
                  conditions and the abundance of potentially
                  competing species suggest factors not explicitly

                  success values lower than or equal to the mean value
                  for resprouters. Post-dispersal reproductive success
                  was predicted in terms of proportions of germinable
                  seeds produced per ovule (as determined by in vitro
                  germination of isolated embryos). Data again varied
                  widely between taxa, averaging 23% conversion of
                  ovules to seeds with no clear relationship to
                  regeneration mode. The mean number of germinable
                  seeds per culm ranged from 0.03 to 21 between
                  species, with cases of particularly low ovule output
                  and/or low germinability in critically low
                  germinable seed numbers for a species. The
                  regeneration potential of a subset of species was
                  assessed as mean annual production of germinable
                  seed per reproducing plant of a population. The data
                  indicated low values (less than eight seeds per
                  adult) for all but three highly fecund species,
                  suggesting that germinable seed output in some
                  species might be scarcely able to compensate for
                  natural senescence or catastrophic loss of parent
                  populations (e.g. after fire, disease, increased
                  competition following eutrophication).},

                  fuel breaks and in adjacent untreated areas to
                  determine if fuel treatments promote the invasion of
                  normative plant species. Understanding the
                  relationship between fuel treatments and normative
                  plants is becoming increasingly important as federal
                  and state agencies are currently implementing large
                  fuel treatment programs throughout the United States
                  to reduce the threat of wildland fire. Our study
                  included 24 fuel breaks located across the State of
                  California. We found that normative plant abundance
                  was over 200% higher on fuel breaks than in adjacent
                  wildland areas. Relative nonnative cover was greater
                  on fuel breaks constructed by bulldozers (28%) than
                  on fuel breaks constructed by other methods
                  (7%). Canopy cover, litter cover, and duff depth
                  also were significantly lower on fuel breaks
                  constructed by bulldozers, and these fuel breaks had
                  significantly more exposed bare ground than other
                  types of fuel breaks. There was a significant
                  decline in relative normative cover with increasing
                  distance from the fuel break, particularly in areas
                  that had experienced more numerous fires during the
                  past 50 years, and in areas that had been
                  grazed. These data suggest that fuel breaks could
                  provide establishment sites for normative
                  plants.. and that nonnatives may invade surrounding
                  areas, especially after disturbances such as fire or
                  grazing. Fuel break construction and maintenance
                  methods that leave some overstory canopy and
                  minimize exposure of bare ground may be less likely
                  to promote normative plants.},

                  competition is unlikely to cause competitive
                  exclusion. Differences between the two species in
                  recruitment levels and fire-mortality are
                  small. Thus their size-class distributions are very
                  similar. They are restricted to shallow-soil rocky
                  habitats, not only because of reduced fire intensity
                  in these sites, but because these are habitats
                  avoided by the faster growing more competitive
                  reseeding Proteaceae. Go-existence of these two
                  species appears to mainly be due to fire keeping

                  scale, more degradation will occur in the soil
                  patches with higher bulk density, mainly because an
                  increased duration of high temperatures in

                  in maquis fires since they will determine the

  abstract =     {Wildfires resulting from thunderstorms are common in
                  some Mediterranean-climate regions, such as southern
                  California, and have played an important role in the
                  ecology and evolution of the
                  flora. Mediterranean-climate regions are major
                  centers for human population and thus anthropogenic
                  impacts on fire regimes may have important
                  consequences on these plant
                  formations. However. changes in fire regimes may
                  have different impacts on Mediterranean
                  type-ecosystems depending on the capability of
                  plants to respond to such perturbations. Therefore,
                  we compare here fire regimes and vegetation
                  responses of two Mediterranean-climate regions which
                  differ in wildfire regimes and history of human
                  occupation, the central zone of Chile (matorral) and
                  the southern area of California in United States
                  (chaparral). In Chile almost all fires result from
                  anthropogenic activities, whereas lightning fires
                  resulting from thunderstorms are frequent in
                  California. In both regions fires are more frequent
                  in summer, due to high accumulation of dry plant
                  biomass for ignition. Humans have markedly increased
                  fires frequency both in the matorral and chaparral,
                  but extent of burned areas has remained unaltered,
                  probably due to better fire suppression actions and
                  a decline in the built-up of dry plant fuel
                  associated to increased landscape fragmentation with
                  less flammable agricultural and urban
                  developments. As expected, post-fire plant
                  regeneration responses differs between the matorral
                  and chaparral due to differences in the importance
                  of wild fires as a natural evolutionary force in the
                  system. Plants from the chaparral show a broader
                  range of post-fire regeneration responses than the
                  matorral, from basal resprouting, to lignotuber
                  resprouting, and to fire-stimulated germination and
                  flowering with fire-specific clues such as heat
                  shock, chemicals from smoke or charred wood. Plants
                  from the matorral have some resprouting capabilities
                  after fire, but these probably evolved from other
                  environmental pressures, such as severe and long
                  summer droughts. herbivory, and volcanism. Although
                  both Mediterranean-type ecosystems have shown to be
                  resilient to anthropogenic fires, increasing fire
                  frequency may be an important factor that needs to
                  be considered as it may result in strong negative
                  effects on plant successional trends and on plant
                  diversity.},

                  ecological conditions, illustrating change in

                  regimes. We review and compare alternative data
                  sources and approaches for mapping fire regimes at
                  national, regional, and local spatial scales. Fire
                  regimes, defined here as the nature of fires
                  occurring over an extended period of time, are
                  closely related to local site productivity and
                  topography, but climate variability entrains fire
                  regimes at regional to national scales. In response
                  to fire exclusion policies, land use, and invasion
                  of exotic plants over the last century, fire regimes
                  have changed greatly, especially in dry forests,
                  woodlands, and grasslands. Comparing among and
                  within geographic regions, and across time, is a
                  powerful way to understand the factors determining
                  and constraining fire patterns. Assembling spatial
                  databases of fire information using consistent
                  protocols and standards will aid comparison between
                  studies, and speed and strengthen
                  analyses. Combining multiple types of data will
                  increase the power and reliability of
                  interpretations. Testing hypotheses about
                  relationships between fire, climate, vegetation,
                  land use, and topography will help to identify what

  abstract =     {Extreme disturbance events may strongly influence
                  the structure and functioning of many ecosystems,
                  articularly those in which large, infrequent events
                  are the defining forces within the region. This
                  paper introduces the extremal fire regime (i.e., the
                  time series of the largest fire per year) and the
                  assumptions implicit in its analysis. I describe the
                  statistics of extremes and demonstrate their
                  application to the fire regime of Los Padres
                  National Forest, California, to compare two regions
                  (i.e., Main and Monterey divisions), to test for a
                  shift in fire regime due to fire suppression, and to
                  examine climatic events as a forcing mechanism for
                  large fires. Despite their similarity and proximity,
                  the Main Division exhibited a much higher frequency
                  of large fires (and shorter return time) compared to
                  the Monterey Division. Comparison of time periods
                  1911-1950 and 1951-1991 indicated that fire
                  suppression had no effect on the distribution of
                  very large fires in the Main Division, although the
                  frequency of fires smaller than similar to 4000 ha
                  declined. Comparing distributions of an index for
                  severity of Santa Ana conditions (i.e.,
                  characterized by hot, dry winds) and extreme fire
                  events in the Main Division indicated a convergence
                  of distributions with increasing event size. The
                  distribution of fire events larger than similar to
                  4000 ha appears to be coupled with that of severe
                  Santa Ana conditions, suggesting a strong climatic
                  forcing for extreme fires and a threshold for the
                  transition from small-to large-fire
                  dynamics. Results indicate the usefulness of
                  extremal fire regime analysis for comparisons over
                  space and time and for examining a potential forcing
                  mechanism. This approach can be applied to any
                  disturbance regime in which large events play an
                  important role, providing ecologists and land
                  managers with a useful tool for understanding and
                  predicting dynamics of extreme disturbance events.},

                  often show dormancy, and germinate in response to
                  fire-related cues. Seeds of some east Australian
                  Grevillea species were known from earlier studies to
                  germinate in response to fires, but gave mixed
                  results when heat shock was tested as a germination
                  stimulus. In the current study, seeds of seven east
                  Australian Grevillea species were tested for their
                  germination response to smoke, to short heat
                  exposure, and to scarification. Seeds were smoked in
                  a chamber by using a mixture of native woodland
                  vegetation as fuel. The smoking and heating
                  treatments were administered to seeds in bulk: this
                  meant that subsequent germination data for these two
                  treatments were not independent. Cumulative
                  germination in the laboratory was scored for up to
                  60 days. All three germination treatments, when
                  administered singly, increased germination: smoke
                  increased germination in all seven species, heat in
                  four species, and scarification in a different four
                  species. Pairwise combinations of the three
                  treatments also increased germination in some
                  species e.g. smoke and heat treatments combined led
                  to the highest germination observed in four species,
                  and to increased germination compared with either
                  treatment singly, in another species. Some treatment
                  combinations appeared to interact: heat and
                  scarification combined led to decreased germination
                  in three species. The role of heat exposure and
                  scarification in increasing germination was not due
                  to the breaking of an impermeable seed coat: water
                  uptake of both scarified and unscarified seeds was
                  rapid and equal (after 24 h) in all seven
                  species. The results indicate that seeds of the
                  Grevillea species investigated are responsive to one
                  or more fire-related germination cues.},

                  coexistence is the key to understanding the
                  relationship between species richness and community
                  productivity. Using model plant communities, we
                  explored two general kinds of mechanisms based on
                  resource heterogeneity and recruitment limitation,
                  with and without any trade-off between reproductive
                  and competitive abilities. We generated different
                  levels of species richness by changing model
                  parameters, in particular the number of species in
                  the regional pool, the degree of recruitment
                  limitation, and the level of
                  heterogeneity. Different diversity-productivity
                  patterns are obtained with different coexistence
                  mechanisms, indicating there is no reason to expect
                  any general relationship between species richness
                  and productivity. We discuss these results in the
                  context of the within-site and across-site aspects
                  of the relationship between species richness and
                  productivity. Furthermore, we extend these results
                  to hypothesize the relationship between species
                  richness and productivity for other coexistence

                  biodiversity of plants and of solitary bees. Fire
                  may kill the brood of soil-nesting and other
                  solitary bees and may affect pollen and nectar
                  sources. Such changes would be expected to influence
                  seed production in populations of post-fire obligate
                  seeder species and thus also their population
                  dynamics. We compared nectar standing crop, flower
                  visitation rate of bumble bees and solitary bees,
                  and consequent seed production in a typical
                  Mediterranean shrub (Salvia fruticosa Miller)
                  growing in unburned east Mediterranean phrygana
                  vegetation and in an adjacent burned area. The
                  volume of nectar standing crop in the burned area
                  was higher than in the unburned area, while the
                  nectar concentration showed the opposite trend. The
                  mean frequency of Bombus' visits was higher in the
                  burned area, while solitary bees visited flowers
                  only in the unburned habitats. The seed production
                  of S. fruticosa was significantly lower in the
                  burned area. This reduction might have a long-term
                  effect on post-fire species composition and
                  abundance due to the fact that this species is an
                  obligate post-fire seeder. The present evidence
                  indicates that the bee-dependent pollination
                  environment was not re-balanced even six years after
                  fire. This situation has important implications

                  patterns of the trees in a Mediterranean pine forest
                  demonstrating that the pre-fire ancestor microsite
                  is occupied also by the next generation. Although
                  Aleppo pine Pinus halepensis Mill. is an obligatory
                  post-fire seeder, it is adapted to regenerate in its
                  pre-fire growing microsite, thus keeping suitable
                  growing sites From generation to generation. We
                  studied the effect of the dead burned adult pines on
                  the density and size of their recruited saplings 2,
                  5, 11 and 20 yr after fire. A comparison of pine
                  sapling density and size was made between the 'near'
                  zone (under the former effect of the burned canopy)
                  and the 'far' zone (beyond the former effect of the
                  burned canopy). In the site 2 yr after fire,
                  seedling density was 56% higher in the 'far' zone
                  than in the 'near' zone, but seedling size was
                  similar. However in the site 20 yr after fire,
                  densities were similar in both zones, but the size
                  was bigger by 89% in the 'near' zone. Thus,
                  population recruitment after fire seems to peak near
                  the burned pine trees rather than at a distance from
                  them, in contrast to Janzen's original 'distance
                  hypothesis' model suggested for undisturbed
                  rainforest. Here we present a new hypothetical model
                  for the spatial pattern of post-fire regeneration of
                  obligate seeder tree species forming open
                  forests. It is proposed that in such trees the
                  microsites which were kept by the burned adult
                  trees, which are killed by the fire, are also the
                  Favorable regeneration microsite for the post-fire
                  generation.},

  abstract =     {Background matching might lower the risk of seeds
                  being eaten by seed predators that search
                  visually. In aviary experiments, we analyzed the
                  selection of different-colored seeds by
                  ground-feeding finches (Fringilla coelebs and
                  F. montifringilla) against four naturally occurring
                  forest soil substrates. The substrates were fresh
                  burn (black), 6-year-old burn (brown), mineral soil
                  (pale yellow) and Pleurozium schreberi feather moss
                  (green). We used color-sorted seeds of Pinus
                  sylvestris, a species with a large natural variation
                  in seed color, ranging from pale yellow to
                  black. Although seeds were scattered on the
                  substrates at a density of only 91 seeds m-2 , birds
                  removed seeds effectively. Both bird species found
                  more pale than dark seeds on the fresh bum
                  substrate. F. montifringilla also recovered more
                  pale than dark seeds on the old burn, and more dark
                  than pale seeds on mineral soil. In moss, the birds
                  found very few seeds compared to the other
                  substrates, and there was no color
                  discrimination. P. sylvestris is frequently
                  regenerating after fire, suggesting that dark seeds
                  would be favored under selection from visually
                  searching predators. Fire-adapted conifers with
                  serotinous cones, e.g., Pinus contorta
                  ssp. latifolia, which spread their seeds primarily
                  on freshly burnt surfaces, produce uniformly black
                  or dark brown seeds. However, regeneration of the
                  non-serotinous P. sylvestris is often extended for
                  several years after a fire, during which substrate
                  color and structure change. This may have helped to
                  maintain variation in seed color. When regeneration
                  of a plant species occurs on a substrate of uniform
                  color, we believe that selection by visually
                  searching seed predators will result in the
                  evolution of cryptic seed color.},

                  with chaparral fire to characterize fundamental
                  scale variation in the intensity of this
                  stand-replacing disturbance. To test how this
                  variation may influence community structure, we
                  studied its effect on the soil seed bank and the
                  distribution of seedlings and resprouts that emerged
                  after fire. To evaluate the long-term significance
                  of initial patterns, we monitored vegetation
                  development for 4-5 yr, thereby encompassing the
                  dynamic portion of the chaparral fire cycle. We
                  studied two stands on level uniform terrain before,
                  during, and after fall fires. Stands were dominated
                  by chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), a postfire
                  seeder/sprouter. Nonsprouting Arctostaphylos and
                  Ceanothus spp. were also present. Preburn
                  vegetation, seed populations, soil heating, and
                  postburn plant growth were analyzed along transects
                  of contiguous 1-m(2) plots, so that we could block
                  them together incrementally to identify scale
                  dependence of patterns. In addition, we directly
                  compared heating effects under the fuel array with
                  those just outside by establishing plots in canopy
                  gaps, under the adjacent canopy, and in gaps created
                  and eliminated by reciprocally translocating
                  fuel. Pre- and postburn seed populations were
                  estimated in soil samples collected from all
                  plots. The proportion of seed that survived above
                  and below 2.5 cm in the soil was determined in a
                  subset of plots. The amount and distribution of
                  canopy fuel that collapsed during fire and smoldered
                  on the ground caused pronounced spatial variation in
                  total surface heating. The strength of relationships
                  among patterns of soil heating, preburn canopy,
                  surviving seeds, and seedlings and herbaceous
                  resprouts was consistently most pronounced in blocks
                  3-5 m long. At this scale, postburn patterns were
                  strongly negatively associated with the amount of
                  preburn canopy and the pattern of soil heating this
                  fuel created. Seedlings or herbaceous resprouts of
                  numerous species were abundant where soil heating
                  was relatively low, most notably in natural and
                  created canopy gaps. Conversely, areas where dense
                  canopy occurred before fire, especially gaps
                  displaced by fuel addition, were barren except for
                  occasional Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus
                  seedlings. These obligate postfire seeders, along
                  with the subshrub Helianthemum scoparium, had more
                  deeply buried seeds, and some of them were able to
                  survive where soil heating was prolonged. However,
                  Helianthemum did not emerge from depth. Seedlings of
                  Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus nearest Adenostoma
                  burls survived significantly better when Adenostoma
                  failed to resprout. This wan common in one burn
                  where heating was relatively high and burl size was
                  small. Seed mortality prevented Adenostoma seedling
                  emergence from occurring where its seeds were most
                  abundant prior to fire, which was in proximity to
                  its burls. Adenostoma seedlings did emerge in areas
                  of lower soil heating, but their survival was
                  inversely related to the density of Helianthemum
                  seedlings. No shrub seedlings emerged after the
                  first year following fire because their seed banks
                  were exhausted by fire-induced mortality and/or
                  germination. After 4-5 yr, few young Adenostoma
                  remained. The combination of seedling and resprout
                  regeneration allowed this shrub to maintain
                  dominance, but to a lesser extent in the older
                  stand. Our results support a vegetation
                  pattern-process model in which local species
                  distributions after fire in Adenostoma chaparral are
                  antecedently linked to the physical and chemical
                  properties of the canopy. These control the nature
                  of combustion, the soil heating that results, and
                  the distribution of seeds and resprout tissues that
                  survive. The vegetation develops entirely from these
                  sources, so fire-induced patterns are manifest in
                  the long-term structure of this vegetation.},

                  California and southwestern Oregon supports globally
                  outstanding temperate biodiversity. Fire has been
                  important in the evolutionary history that shaped
                  this diversity, but recent human influences have
                  altered the fire environment. We tested for modern
                  human impacts on the fire regime by analyzing
                  temporal patterns in fire extent and spatial
                  patterns of fire severity in relation to vegetation
                  structure, past fire occurrence, roads, and timber
                  management in a 98,814-ha area burned in 1987. Fire
                  severity was mapped by the US. Department of
                  Agriculture Forest Service as low, moderate, and
                  high based on levels of canopy scorch and
                  consumption. We found (1) a trend of increasing fire
                  size in recent decades; (2) that overall
                  fire-severity proportions were 59% low, 29%
                  moderate, and 12% high, which is comparable to both
                  contemporary and historic fires in the region; (3)
                  that multiaged, closed forests, the predominant
                  vegetation, burned with much lower severity than did
                  open forest and shrubby nonforest vegetation; (4)
                  that considerably less high-severity fire occurred
                  where fire bad previously be absent since 1920 in
                  closed forests compared to where the forests had
                  burned since 1920 (7% vs. 16%); (5) that nonforest
                  vegetation burned with greater severity where there
                  was a history of fire since 1920 and in roaded
                  areas; and (6) that tree plantations experienced
                  twice as much severe fire as multi-aged forests. We
                  concluded that fuel buildup in the absence of fire
                  did not cause increased fire severity as
                  hypothesized. Instead, fuel that is receptive to
                  combustion may decrease in the long absence of fire
                  in the closed forests of our study area, which will
                  favor the fire regime that has maintained these
                  forests. However, plantations are now found in
                  one-third of the roaded landscape. Together with
                  warming climate, this may increase the size and
                  severity of future fires, favoring further
                  establishment of structurally and biologically
                  simple plantations.},

  abstract =     {In evolution, adaptation is traditionally viewed as
                  a process by which natural selection moulds
                  organisms to fit pre-established environmental
                  templates. The changes organisms cause in
                  environments are seldom thought evolutionarily
                  significant. However, organisms partly create their
                  own environments by 'niche construction'. A formal
                  model of niche construction is discussed. It
                  focusses on two genetic loci, E and A. It assumes:
                  (i) a population's capacity for niche construction
                  is influenced by genes at the E locus; (ii) the
                  amount of an environmental resource, R, depends on
                  niche construction; (iii) changes in R affect
                  selection at the A locus. This model produces some
                  surprising results. For example, timelags occur
                  between the spread of niche construction and the
                  response to the selection it generates. Niche
                  construction also enhances the role of phenotypes in
                  evolution. Organisms not only carry and propagate
                  genes, but they also modify the selection pressures
                  that select those genes. This dual role changes the
                  relationship between genetic evolution; individual
                  development; learning; and cultural processes in
                  human beings.},

  abstract =     {1. Up to 50% or more of the savanna landscapes of
                  northern Australia are burnt each year, but the
                  effects of these fires on savanna faunas are poorly
                  known, especially for arthropods. 2. We investigated
                  the responses of grass-layer beetles to three fire
                  regimes (unburnt - fires excluded; early - annual
                  fires lit early during the dry season; late - annual
                  fires lit late during the dry season) as part of a
                  landscape-scale fire experiment at Kapalga in
                  Australia's Northern Territory, where replicated
                  fire regimes were applied to 15-20-km(2) landscape
                  units over a 5-year period. We also sought to
                  identify beetle species that might act as indicators
                  of particular fire regimes, and examined the extent
                  to which analysis at the family level is sufficient
                  to reveal patterns evident from species-level
                  analysis. 3. Beetles were sampled using sweep nets
                  during February (mid-wet season) and May (end of wet
                  season) each year, from 1989 (18 months prior to the
                  imposition of fire treatments) to 1995 (after 5
                  years of treatments). 4. A total of 3865 beetles
                  from 233 species was recorded, with the dominant
                  families Chrysomelidae (leaf beetles) and
                  Curculionidae (weevils) contributing 91% of all
                  beetles and 57% of total species. 5. Total beetle
                  abundance, species richness, family richness and the
                  abundances of one of the 10 most common species were
                  significantly affected by fire treatment according
                  to anova. In all cases, beetle abundance and
                  richness were similar in the two burning treatments,
                  but greater than in the unburnt treatment. These
                  differences were only apparent during the second
                  half of the experiment. The responses were mirrored
                  by changes in composition at species, family and
                  guild levels, according to multivariate
                  analysis. 6. According to indicator analysis, five
                  beetle species were significant indicators of late
                  fires, and one of early fires. All these species
                  were infrequently recorded and therefore of limited
                  use for management. However, two common species were
                  indicative of burnt habitats if early and late
                  treatments are considered together. 7. Family
                  richness was highly correlated (R(2) = 0.615) with
                  species richness, and multivariate, analysis of
                  family-level abundances revealed the compositional
                  changes in relation to fire that were evident in
                  species-level analysis. Family was therefore a
                  reliable surrogate of species for detecting beetle
                  responses. 8. Although we found significant effects
                  of our experimental treatments, in the broader
                  context of overall beetle dynamics the assemblages
                  appeared to be remarkably resilient to fire. This
                  reflects a long history of association with frequent
                  fire, and is consistent with many other components
                  of the northern Australian fauna, where fire appears
                  to be of secondary importance to variation in
                  rainfall and soil type. 9. The lack of effect of
                  fire timing on grass-layer beetles calls into
                  question a management paradigm that focuses largely
                  on fire intensity, and suggests that fire management
                  needs to be more mindful of fire frequency.},

                  evolution of plant reproductive allocation
                  patterns. We evaluated this hypothesis for Florida
                  (USA) scrub plants by developing three models of
                  reproductive effort with time since last fire given
                  assumptions concerning seed dormancy and seedling
                  establishment. We then examined reproductive effort
                  of five woody, resprouting shrubs at sites
                  representing nine times since last fire (ranging
                  from 0-64 yr). All species showed significant
                  patterns with time since fire in percentage of stems
                  reproductive and fruit production. Stems of all
                  species needed to attain a minimum size before
                  flowering. Four species had the greatest level of
                  reproductive effort (fruit biomass/above-ground
                  biomass) within 5 yr post-fire and best fit the
                  Early Peak Model of reproductive effort
                  (i.e. between-fire seedling recruitment or seed
                  dormancy). A fifth species best fit the Broad Peak
                  Model (i.e. immediate post-fire seedling
                  establishment), peaking in reproductive effort at 7
                  yr post-fire. Both of these models are based on
                  somewhat variable fire-return intervals, suggesting
                  that the frequency of scrub fires may have been too
                  unpredictable to select for reproductive allocation
                  patterns precisely reflecting particular fire-retum
                  intervals. Early peaks in post-fire reproductive
                  effort may be a bet-hedging strategy to allow for
                  greater chances of seedling establishment and

                  because they colonize disturbed habitats before the
                  arrival of late successional dominant
                  competitors. The second underpins the niche
                  hypothesis, in which early successional species are
                  able to persist, even with unlimited colonization by
                  late successional dominants, because they specialize

                  which the outcome of competition among juveniles for
                  vacant space is determined by one of several
                  underlying mechanistic submodels. Environmental
                  heterogeneity that affects the outcome of
                  competition is present in all of these models and
                  may be spatial, temporal, biotic in origin, abiotic
                  in origin, or any mixture of these. The principal
                  result is that the models predict coexistence if the
                  plant species are sufficiently dissimilar-if they
                  sufficiently partition the spatial, temporal,
                  biotic, or abiotic environmental

                  episodically, or in punctuational
                  bursts. Phylogenies, in combination with information
                  on species, contain the imprint of these historical
                  evolutionary processes. By applying comparative
                  methods based upon statistical models of evolution
                  to well resolved phylogenies, it is possible to
                  infer the historical evolutionary processes that
                  must have existed in the past, given the patterns of
                  diversity seen in the present. I describe a set of
                  maximum likelihood statistical methods for inferring
                  such processes. The methods estimate parameters of
                  statistical models for inferring correlated
                  evolutionary change in continuously varying
                  characters, for detecting correlated evolution in
                  discrete characters, for estimating rates of
                  evolution, and for investigating the nature of the
                  evolutionary process itself. They also anticipate
                  the wealth of information becoming available to
                  biological scientists from genetic studies that pin
                  down relationships among organisms with

                  be modeled by varying the landscape's fractal
                  dimension, D. I simulated landscapes in which D
                  varied independently of environmental
                  variability. Individuals of 10 species with modes
                  placed evenly along the dominant environmental
                  gradient were randomly placed on these landscapes
                  and were allowed to reproduce, disperse, and
                  compete. The results demonstrate that the effect of
                  a landscape's environmental variability on species
                  coexistence is affected by the degree of spatial
                  dependence in a complex manner. Increasing the
                  fractal dimension (decreasing spatial dependence)
                  allows more species to exist per microsite and per
                  landscape. However, extremely high fractal
                  dimensions cause fewer species to coexist on the
                  landscape scale. Observed habitat breadths are
                  increased (and beta diversity is decreased) as a
                  function of D. I suggest that these patterns can be
                  explained by habitat area, the mass effect,
                  ecological equivalency, and global biological

                  Florida and the southern tip of Alabama. The present
                  distribution of P. clausa is divided into two
                  purported varieties: var. clausa in peninsular
                  Florida and var. immuginata primarily in the Florida
                  panhandle. We determined allozyme diversity and
                  population genetic structure for 12 populations of
                  var. clausa and 9 populations of var. immuginata. At
                  the species level, 88% of the 26 loci examined were
                  polymorphic. The genetic diversity maintained at
                  both the species (H-ES = 0.100) and population (H-ep
                  = 0.092) levels was low, relative to most other pine
                  species. Genetic differentiation among populations
                  was also relatively low (G-ST = 0.054). Genetic
                  distances between populations of the same variety
                  (mean D = 0.006) were lower than genetic distances
                  between populations of different varieties (mean D =

                  loci differed significantly between the two

                  genetic variation apparent at the species level
                  (intervarietal differentiation, G-V = 0.014). The

                  steam-releasing open-calorimeters were used as
                  fire-meters during the burn. Post hoc measurements
                  used were estimations of heat output per unit area,
                  and measurements of the minimum diameter of branches
                  of Cytisus remaining after the fire. Time above 150
                  degrees C was obtained from measurements made with
                  thermocouples placed at the soil surface in 20
                  contiguous 1 x 1 m squares of the burn plot. All
                  other measurements were made at each 1 x 1 m in the
                  22 x 3 m rectangle surrounding, and including, the
                  thermocouple squares. Various simple and multiple
                  regression models were constructed to predict time
                  above 150 degrees C from each of the four
                  measurements made during or after the fire. Maximum
                  coefficients of determination obtained for
                  regressions were 0.61 and 0.62 for water mass loss
                  from open-calorimeters and branch diameter,
                  respectively. Using all the variables in a multiple
                  regression model, time above 150 degrees C was
                  related to water mass loss from open-calorimeters
                  and heat output per unit area with a coefficient of
                  determination of 0.77. It is concluded that
                  estimations of time above 150 degrees C at the soil
                  surface during the passage of fire may be possible
                  based on simple devices, such as open-calorimeters,
                  or on biological indicators, such as minimum branch
                  diameters. Additionally, combining two methods
                  (open-calorimeters, estimations of heat output per
                  unit area) may allow the reconstruction of the time
                  above 150 degrees C during the fire at a scale of 1
                  m(2), an important characteristic of a burn to
                  understand ecosystem response to fire.},

                  biodiversity, yet in comparison to taxonomic
                  diversity, methods of quantifying functional
                  diversity are less well developed. Here, we propose
                  a means for quantifying functional diversity that
                  may be particularly useful for determining how
                  functional diversity is related to ecosystem
                  functioning. This measure of functional diversity
                  "FD" is defined as the total branch length of a
                  functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD
                  make it preferable to other measures of functional
                  diversity, such as the number of functional groups
                  in a community. Simulating species' trait values
                  illustrates how the relative importance of richness
                  and composition for FD depends on the effective
                  dimensionality of the trait space in which species
                  separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance
                  of community composition and functional
                  redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance
                  of species richness and decreases functional
                  redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space
                  increases the relative importance of community
                  composition. Five natural communities show
                  remarkably similar relationships between FD and
                  species richness. },

  abstract =     {1. Changes in biodiversity can affect ecosystem
                  processes through a variety of pathways, such as
                  changes in community structure, loss of a keystone
                  or changes in resource use patterns among
                  species. The latter, also known as resource use
                  complementarity, is an established mechanistic link
                  between species and ecosystems. 2. At present,
                  functional group richness is the dominant measure of
                  the extent of resource use complementarity and has
                  been manipulated in several experiments. These
                  groups are constructed a priori using information
                  about differences between species and a
                  statistically significant effect is typically
                  identified by standard parametric tests. These tests
                  implicitly assume that the a priori functional
                  groups are correct. 3. Avoiding this assumption
                  requires a randomization (bootstrap) test of
                  statistical significance that accounts for the
                  effects of grouping per se. This test compares the
                  observed test statistic to the distribution of the
                  test statistic resulting from random assignment of
                  species to groups. 4. Re-analyses of experimental
                  manipulations of plant functional diversity by
                  bootstrapping the critical significance value
                  changed the ecological interpretation of results in
                  nearly half of the experiments. This occurred
                  because random assignment of species to functional
                  groups frequently creates a strong relationship
                  between functional diversity and ecosystem
                  functioning. 5. The significant bootstrapped results
                  that were found perhaps represent some of the most
                  convincing evidence that functional diversity is an
                  important determinant of local-scale ecosystem
                  functioning. },

                  lattice model, CAPS, was designed to examine
                  multiple processes responsible for spatial patterns
                  of abundance and diversity of sessile species in
                  heterogeneous landscapes. Species simulated by CAPS
                  differ in habitat preferences (niche width),
                  dispersal of propagules, and relative fecundity. The
                  spatial distribution of habitat types are
                  represented as heterogeneous gridded landscapes. The
                  outcome of competition and establishment processes
                  in successive generations is determined locally via
                  a seed lottery. A series of 200 year-long
                  simulations was performed to investigate the effects
                  of variation in species characteristics and
                  competition, landscape heterogeneity, and
                  disturbance on patterns of species abundances. The
                  outcome of competition was most sensitive to
                  differences in fecundity between species, the
                  spatial distribution of suitable habitat and the
                  initial distribution of species. Species with a
                  narrow niche were confined to a single habitat type
                  and remained at or near their initialization
                  sites. Broader niches resulted in increasing niche
                  overlap and competition but enhanced species
                  mobility, allowing abundance levels to approach
                  expected values determined by map resources. Even
                  so, initial distributions still affected the spatial
                  patterns of species distributions at year
                  200. Disturbance regimes were simulated by varying
                  the frequency. extent and spatial pattern of
                  disturbances. Disturbance events removed species
                  from affected sites but did not other-wise alter
                  habitat characteristics. Results showed that
                  disturbances may lead to a reversal in competition
                  and establishment, dependent on species-specific
                  differences in fecundity and dispersal. Although
                  intermediate levels of disturbance frequency and
                  extent increased the probability of species
                  coexistence, the spatial pattern of disturbance
                  played an unexpectedly important role in the
                  tradeoff between dispersal and fecundity. The
                  ability to simulate multiple factors affecting
                  patterns of persistence, abundance and spatial
                  distribution of species provided by CAPS allows new
                  insight into the temporal and spatial patterns of
                  community development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

                  polyphyletic. Three main lineages appear to have

                  Rosoideae sensu stricto, including taxa with a base

                  actinorhizal Rosaceae, a group of taxa that engage
                  in symbiotic nitrogen fixation; and 3) the rest of

                  included in the rbcL study, was strongly supported
                  as the sister taxon to Maloideae sensu lato. A New
                  World origin of Maloideae is suggested. The position

                  unresolved.},

                  and mass per shoot) and stein cross-sectional area
                  were compared between habitats using six species
                  pairs representing three genera (Arctostaphylos,
                  Baccharis, Ceanothus). We measured correlations
                  among evolutionary changes in
                  allometric. morphological, and physiological traits
                  using phylogenetic independent contrasts. Allometric
                  analysis revealed habitat differences: slopes were
                  homogeneous among species (= 1.46), but the more
                  mesic-adapted species generally supported more leaf
                  area at a common stem cross-sectional area. Reducing
                  bivariate allometry to a ratio obscured this pattern
                  because ratios varied with stem size, which was
                  unrelated to habitat. Mean individual leaf size also
                  was not correlated with either water availability or
                  leaf stem allometry. Stem hydraulic conductivity was
                  generally lower in the xeric-adapted species of each
                  pair, and its evolution mirrored changes in shoot
                  allometry. This study provides evidence for repeated
                  evolutionary divergence in shoot allometry and
                  hydraulic architecture associated with water
                  availability and demonstrates the importance of
                  shoot allometry to water relations, independent of
                  leaf size.},

  abstract =     {The use of the independent contrast method in
                  comparative tests is studied. It is assumed that:
                  (i) the traits under investigation are subject to
                  natural selection; (ii) closely related species are
                  similar because they share many characteristics of
                  their niche, inherited from a common ancestor; and
                  (iii) the current adaptive significance of the
                  traits is the focus of investigation. The main
                  objection to the use of species values in this case
                  is that third variables which are shared by closely
                  related species confound the relationship between
                  the focal traits. In this paper, I argue that third
                  variables are largely not controlled by the contrast
                  methods, which are designed to estimate correlated
                  evolution. To the extent that third variables also
                  show correlated evolution, the true relationship
                  among the traits of interest will remain
                  obscured. Although the independent contrast method
                  does not resolve the influence of third traits it
                  does, in principle, provide a greater resolution
                  than the use of the species mean values. However,
                  its validity depends on the applicability of an
                  evolutionary model which has a substantial
                  stochastic component. To illustrate the consequences
                  of relaxing this assumption I consider an
                  alternative model of an adaptive radiation, where
                  species come to fill a fixed niche space. Under this
                  model, the expected value for the contrast
                  correlation differs from that for the species
                  correlation. The two correlations differ because
                  contrasts reflect the historical pattern of
                  diversification among species, whereas the species
                  values describe the present-day relationships among
                  the species. If the latter is of interest, I suggest
                  that assessing significance based on the species
                  correlations can be justified, providing that
                  attention is paid to the role of potentially
                  confounding third traits. Often, differences between
                  contrast and species correlations may be
                  biologically informative, reflecting changes in
                  correlations between traits as an adaptive radiation
                  proceeds; contrasts may be particularly useful as a
                  means of investigating past history, rather than
                  current utility of traits.},

                  Reserve, South Africa. Management records were used
                  to examine the role of post-fire age, fire frequency
                  and intensity, as well as biotic interactions
                  (competition from overstorey proteoids and alien
                  plants) in influencing vegetation composition over
                  this time period. The mean similarity in species
                  composition of sites between surveys was 62%,
                  indicating an average of nearly 40% turnover in
                  species over the 30 year period. The main causes of
                  this change included differences resulting from
                  different stages in the post-fire succession as well
                  as the impact of differential fire regimes
                  (especially frequency effects). Competition from
                  serotinous Proteaceae, which proved highly mobile
                  after fire, as well as invasive Australian acacias
                  also impacted on the composition of the,vegetation

                  by a variety of processes. The study also provided

                  contributing to the high species diversity in fynbos

                  Hypericum cumulicola, and Polygonella
                  basiramia. Responses included seed germination,
                  survival, biomass, and fecundity. Transplants into
                  recently burned patches generally had higher
                  survival, larger biomass, and greater reproductive
                  output than transplants into long-unburned
                  patches. Open areas and sites near oaks frequently
                  were more favorable than sites near Florida
                  rosemary. Ground lichens did not affect germination
                  but increased mortality rate of
                  seedlings. Neighboring small shrubby and herbaceous
                  species did not affect the performance of these
                  species. Of the three species, naturally occurring
                  E. cuneifolium were farthest from large shrubs, and
                  their microhabitats had the least ground lichens and
                  shrubs. Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola are
                  capable of forming persistent seed banks and their
                  recruitment after fire depends mostly on these
                  dormant seeds. Polygonella basiramia relies on seed
                  dispersal and immediate seed germination to colonize
                  recently burned patches. Management for these
                  species should involve variable fire regimes to
                  allow all three species to persist along with many
                  other scrub endemics.},

                  are often seen(4-6), but the underlying causes are
                  difficult to disentangle and remain
                  unclear(7-9). Here we examine directly the role of
                  ecological opportunity and competition in driving
                  genetic diversification. We use the common aerobic
                  bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens(10), which evolves
                  rapidly under novel environmental conditions to
                  generate a large repertoire of mutants(11-13). When
                  provided with ecological opportunity (afforded by
                  spatial structure), identical populations diversify
                  morphologically, but when ecological opportunity is
                  restricted there is no such divergence. In spatially
                  structured environments, the evolution of variant
                  morphs follows a predictable sequence and we show
                  that competition among the newly evolved
                  niche-specialists maintains this variation. These
                  results demonstrate that the elementary processes of
                  mutation and selection alone are suifficient to
                  promote rapid proliferation of new designs and
                  support the theory that trade-offs in competitive
                  ability drive adaptive radiation(14,15).},

                  past 100 years presents an opportunity to determine
                  and monitor population bottleneck effects on genetic
                  diversity in trees. To provide benchmarks and

                  recent and future bottleneck events and to assist
                  development of conservation strategies, we assessed
                  genetic diversity and structure of six small,
                  isolated white pine populations from two regions at
                  the limits of its geographical range in Newfoundland
                  for comparison with three populations from its
                  central range in Ontario for 20 allozyme loci coding
                  for 12 enzymes. On average, 47.8% of the loci were
                  polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus was
                  1.75, and the observed and expected heterozygosities
                  were 0.215 and 0.195, respectively. Although most of
                  the alleles were widespread, unique alleles were
                  found in three of the nine populations examined. The
                  Newfoundland populations were as genetically
                  variable as those from Ontario. Generally, all
                  populations exhibited slight excess of heterozygotes
                  at most loci. Only 6.1% of the detected genetic
                  variation was among populations, and the remainder
                  among individuals within populations. The genetic
                  distances among the populations within a province or
                  region were as great as those among populations
                  between the provinces or regions. Canonical
                  discriminant functions and cluster analysis from
                  genetic distances separated nine populations into
                  the same four groups. Neither provincial nor
                  regional or geographic gradient-related patterns of
                  population variation and differentiation were
                  apparent. It appears that 8000 years of postglacial
                  geographic isolation and recent population decline
                  have had little or no detectable effect on genetic
                  diversity or differentiation of disjunct
                  Newfoundland white pine populations from their
                  ancestral mainland populations. Assuming their
                  adaptability, the Ontario seed sources may be
                  acceptable for white pine restoration in

                  the model to simulate richness in complex
                  two-dimensional domains and to fit real patterns in
                  species richness, using South American Tyrannidae as
                  an example. We found that a mid-spatial peak in
                  species richness arises spontaneously under
                  conditions of high environmental tolerances and/or a
                  weak environmental gradient, since this condition
                  causes wide species' geographic ranges, which are
                  constrained by domain's boundary and tend to overlap
                  in the middle. Our model was also a good predictor
                  of real patterns in species richness, especially
                  under conditions of high environmental strength and
                  small species' tolerance. We conclude that this kind
                  of spatial simulation models based on species'
                  physiological tolerance may be an important tool to

  abstract =     {A persistent question in the evolution of life
                  histories is the fitness trade-off between
                  reproducing only once (semelparity) in a lifetime or
                  reproducing repeated times in different seasons
                  (iteroparity). The problem can be formulated into a
                  research agenda by assuming that one reproductive
                  strategy is resident (has already evolved) and by
                  asking whether invasion (evolution) of an
                  alternative reproductive strategy is possible. For a
                  spatially nonstructured system, Bulmer (1994)
                  derived the relationship nu + P-A < 1 (P-A is adult
                  survival; nu b(S) and b(S) are offspring numbers for
                  iteroparous and semelparous breeding strategies,
                  respectively) at which semelparous population cannot
                  be invaded by an iteroparous mutant. When the
                  inequality is changed to nu + P-A > 1, invasion of a
                  semelparous mutant is not possible. From the
                  inequalities, it is easy to see that possibilities
                  for evolutionary establishment of a novel
                  reproductive strategy are rather narrow. We extended
                  the evolutionary scenario into a spatially
                  structured system with dispersal linkage among the
                  subunits. In this domain, a rare reproductive
                  strategy can easily invade a population dominated by
                  a resident reproductive strategy. The parameter
                  space enabling invasion is far more generous with
                  spatially structured evolutionary scenarios than in
                  a spatially nonstructured system.},

  abstract =     {A small-variance approximation technique for
                  examining the evolution of reproductive effort is
                  developed, using a decomposition of fitness into
                  arithmetic mean and variance components. Trait
                  values often translate nonlinearly into fitness
                  components such as offspring number or growth
                  rate. A nonlinear relationship between phenotypic
                  traits and fitness implies that the expected value
                  of the fitness component will be a function of the
                  arithmetic mean and variance in the traits
                  influencing a given fitness component. The maximum
                  expression of traits is often, however, a function
                  of reproductive effort. Reproductive effort then
                  influences the mean and variance in traits that
                  affect fitness. Consequently, we can use these
                  techniques to determine the optimal allocation of
                  resources to current reproduction via their effects
                  on the distribution of trait values. The optimal
                  pattern of allocation is influenced by the quality
                  and variability of the habitat and by the curvature
                  of the trait-fitness relationship. The full range of
                  adaptive responses, from semelparity to different
                  degrees of iteroparity, can be predicted from the
                  model. We extend the model to cases where
                  reproductive effort can be partitioned into
                  different offspring types, for example, offspring
                  produced through chasmogamous and cleistogamous
                  flowers. When more than one type of offspring is
                  produced, then reproductive risks can be spread
                  across offspring types and the conditions favoring
                  semelparity are less restrictive. Semelparity is
                  especially favored if the offspring types exhibit
                  negative covariance in their contributions to growth
                  rate. This new technique appears generally
                  consistent with traditional life history theory, but
                  can lead to some new insights that result from the
                  explicit partitioning of the effects of central
                  tendency and variability in trait-fitness
                  relationships.},

  abstract =     {An individual host's likelihood of acquiring an
                  infectious disease depends, in large part, on the
                  location of the host relative to sources of
                  infection, proximity to other hosts, and occupation
                  of specific microhabitats that confer increased
                  susceptibility. Spatial organization of the host and
                  pathogen populations then may be critical in
                  determining patterns of disease occurrence and
                  dynamics. We discuss three fundamental problems
                  associated with understanding the interactions of
                  plants, pathogens, and spatial structure: (1) how
                  one characterizes spatial patterns, (2) how we
                  determine spatial dynamic processes from a given
                  spatial pattern, and (3) how we then simulate the
                  spatial dynamics presumed to be dominating a given
                  host-pathogen interaction. To demonstrate methods
                  for the characterization of spatial pattern, we
                  analyzed spatial maps of a Silene latifolia
                  population infected with the anther smut
                  Microbotryum violaceum, using join-count statistics,
                  continuous spatial autocorrelation, and Mantel's
                  test. Different statistical techniques provided
                  different interpretations of the same data set,
                  indicating the value of using multiple methods. We
                  described spatial structure in the plant population,
                  the pathogen population (factoring out the plant
                  population structure), and spatial cross correlation
                  between two variables (plant gender and disease
                  status). Each of these tests provides information on
                  how the disease may be spreading in the
                  population. We are not very optimistic about the
                  prospect of determining underlying disease-spread
                  processes purely from analysis of spatial
                  pattern. Most spatial patterns can potentially be
                  generated by a number of biological processes (e.g.,
                  ''true'' vs. ''apparent'' contagion), and it is not
                  possible to distinguish between hypotheses without
                  additional information about the system. A
                  difficulty in modeling spatial processes is
                  simulation of populations with given spatial

                  and evolutionary inferences from character data. The
                  number of gains and losses of a binary trait on a
                  phylogeny can be plotted over a range of cost
                  assumptions, to reveal the inflection point at which
                  there is a switch from more gains to moro losses and
                  the point at which all changes are inferred to be in
                  one direction or the other. Phylogenetic structure
                  in the data, the tree shape, and the relative
                  frequency of states among the taxa influence the
                  shape of such graphs and complicate the
                  interpretation of possible permutation-based tests

                  quantified by iterative ancestral-state

                  helps identify the most robust inferences of change

  abstract =     {At a time when historical biogeography appears to be
                  again expanding its scope after a period of focusing
                  primarily on discerning area relationships using
                  cladograms, new inference methods are needed to
                  bring more kinds of data to bear on questions about
                  the geographic history of lineages. Here we describe
                  a likelihood framework for inferring the evolution
                  of geographic range on phylogenies that models
                  lineage dispersal and local extinction in a set of
                  discrete areas as stochastic events in continuous
                  time. Unlike existing methods for estimating
                  ancestral areas, such as dispersal-vicariance
                  analysis, this approach incorporates information on
                  the timing of both lineage divergences and the
                  availability of connections between areas (dispersal
                  routes). Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate
                  branch-specific transition probabilities for
                  geographic ranges, enabling the likelihood of the
                  data (observed species distributions) to be
                  evaluated for a given phylogeny and parameterized
                  paleogeographic model. We demonstrate how the method
                  can be used to address two biogeographic questions:
                  What were the ancestral geographic ranges on a
                  phylogenetic tree? How were those ancestral ranges
                  affected by speciation and inherited by the daughter
                  lineages at cladogenesis events? For illustration we
                  use hypothetical examples and an analysis of a
                  Northern Hemisphere plant clade (Cercis), comparing
                  and contrasting inferences to those obtained from
                  dispersal-vicariance analysis. Although the
                  particular model we implement is somewhat
                  simplistic, the framework itself is flexible and
                  could readily be modified to incorporate additional
                  sources of information and also be extended to
                  address other aspects of historical biogeography.},

                  function and examined changes in the parameters to
                  quantify changes in species richness of all plants
                  together, trees only and non-trees over five scales
                  of magnitude (0.01 m(2) to 400 m(2)) after a
                  wildfire in the Linville Gorge Wilderness Area,
                  North Carolina, USA. 2 Increases in species richness
                  of all plants together occurred after the fire at
                  all scales and increased in magnitude as scale
                  increased. However, a lack of change in the slopes
                  (z-values) of species-area curves indicates that
                  proportional changes were independent of scale of
                  observation below 400 m(2). Changes in species
                  richness were predominantly driven by immigration,
                  which was significantly related to fire
                  severity. Survival of species present pre-fire was
                  greater than local extinction, but neither was
                  related to severity. 3 Species richness of trees
                  increased at all scales but proportional increases
                  were smaller at larger scales and slopes of
                  species-area curves decreased after the fire. Local
                  seedling recruitment increased species richness at
                  small scales, but low rates of immigration due to
                  dispersal limitation in most species limited
                  increases at larger scales. 4 Directional changes in
                  species richness of non-trees were not always
                  consistent at fine scales but both absolute and
                  relative changes were positive at scales >= 1 m(2)
                  and increased with increasing scale. Slopes of
                  species-area curves increased post-fire because
                  localized patterns of immigration within plots
                  resulted in little mixing of species at small scales
                  but large changes in species richness at larger
                  scales. 5 Fire in the southern Appalachians
                  increases plant species richness within local
                  communities, but rates of species turnover and
                  patterns of beta diversity are maintained by local
                  recruitment of tree seedlings at small scales and
                  immigration of herb, shrub and vine species at
                  larger scales. 6 Although decreased levels of
                  competition after disturbance promote species
                  coexistence at small scales, changes in species
                  richness at larger scales are determined by the
                  degree that the local community is linked to the
                  species pool of the surrounding landscape through
                  processes related to dispersal, particularly mass
                  effects.},

  abstract =     {At fine spatial scales (0.1 - 10 m), chaparral
                  communities have been shown to be strongly
                  influenced by canopy-gap patterns, leading to
                  periodicities in vegetation at 4 - 5 m spatial
                  scales. Fine-scale variations in fire behavior and
                  post-fire erosion can lead to changes in the
                  patterning of viable seeds and nutrients and may
                  alter the spatial patterning of post-fire chaparral
                  communities. This study deals with the relationship
                  among fire behavior, post-fire nutrient
                  availabilities and vegetation patterns in a 1-yr
                  old, post-fire Adenostoma fasciculatum chaparral
                  community in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
                  California, USA. Variations in mineral soil
                  exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg) and extractable
                  phosphorus (PO4-P) were correlated with ash
                  distribution. Cations and measures of ammonium and
                  nitrate were also correlated with fire intensity,
                  measured by the diameter of the smallest remaining
                  A. fasciculatum twigs following fire. Fire intensity
                  was correlated with the pattern of post-fire
                  vegetation establishment based on first axis DCA
                  scores. However, ash PO4-P was more highly
                  correlated with sample DCA scores, local species
                  richness and total cover (p < 0.01), suggesting that
                  small-scale variations in PO4-P which correlate with
                  ash distributions may be important in structuring
                  this community. Two- and three-term local variance
                  analysis revealed a maximum of pattern intensity in
                  DCA first axis scores at 4 - 5 m intervals that
                  likely corresponds to pre-fire canopy-gap
                  patterns. However, total cover showed pattern at
                  spatial scales of 8 - 10 m, and was correlated at
                  this scale with patterns of ash distribution and
                  fire intensity. Microtopographic patterns also occur
                  at similar spatial scales. Microtopographic patterns
                  appear important in determining post-fire plant
                  nutrient and water distributions and, thereby,
                  patterns of plant establishment. Thus, the scale and
                  intensity of post-fire vegetation pattern may differ
                  considerably from pre-fire conditions.},

                  evolutionary dynamics is currently a key topic in
                  theoretical ecology. We use a 'well-mixed'
                  analytical model and spatially explicit
                  individual-based models to investigate a system
                  where a population is subject to rare disturbance
                  events. The disturbance can only propagate through
                  regions of the population where the density of
                  individuals is sufficiently high and individuals
                  affected by the disturbance die shortly after. We
                  find that populations where individuals are sessile
                  often exhibit very different dynamic behaviour when
                  compared to populations where individuals are mobile
                  and spatially well mixed. When mutations are allowed
                  which affect either offspring birth rates or
                  mortality rates, the well-mixed populations always
                  evolve to a state where a single disturbance event
                  leads to extinction. Populations often persist
                  substantially longer if individuals are sessile and
                  they disperse their offspring locally. We also find
                  that for sessile populations selection may favour
                  short-lived individuals with limited offspring
                  production. Population dynamics are found to be
                  strongly influenced by the host characters that are
                  evolving and the rate at which host variation is
                  introduced into the system.},

                  of a plant species to a particular site is addressed
                  by considering 53 cases in which the distribution of
                  pines (Pinus species; Pinaceae) has changed in the
                  last century. We consider expansions of pines in and
                  adjacent to their natural ranges in the Northern
                  Hemisphere and the spread from sites of introduction
                  in the Southern Hemisphere well outside the
                  contemporary range of pines. We first consider a
                  neutral hypothesis (with respect to climate or
                  biological interactions as determinants of
                  invasion): invasion simply requires that a species
                  is present in sufficient numbers, with sufficient
                  propagules over sufficient time to invade. We then
                  explore the relative importance of climatic changes,
                  disturbance, competition (including competition
                  between seedlings and herbaceous plants during early
                  establishment), herbivory, pathogens, and other
                  agents that might influence pine membership in
                  communities. Determinants of susceptibility to
                  invasion often interact in a complex
                  fashion. Environmental stresses created by moisture
                  and temperature appear to exercise primary control
                  on invasibility at xeric and high-elevation sites,
                  respectively, but play a smaller role at
                  intermediate locations. At these sites, range limits
                  are determined principally by interactions between
                  pine seedlings and the resident biota in adjacent
                  communities. This suggests that the effects of
                  predicted global warming on the distribution of
                  pines are unlikely to be simple functions of
                  temperature or precipitation, except at climatic
                  extremes. Pine invasions are most prevalent where
                  there is limited competition in the regeneration
                  niche and occur more easily in habitats where the
                  dominant growth form is not different from that of
                  pines, namely, in grasslands. The disturbance regime
                  in the receiving habitat is important and interacts
                  directly and indirectly with the "inherent"
                  susceptibility to invasion. Severe disturbances may
                  initiate pine invasions at any latitude, but are
                  essential for reducing the cover of vigorous plant
                  growth (and hence competition in the regeneration
                  niche) in tropical and near-tropical
                  regions. Contemporary practices such as
                  deforestation and increased grazing pressure and
                  those practices leading to accelerated erosion,
                  modified fire regimes, and climate amelioration
                  essentially duplicate ice-age stresses and
                  disturbances that shaped plant communities in the
                  Holocene. The fundamental role of biotic factors
                  (either direct or indirect) in regulating the
                  distribution of pines is discussed with reference to
                  aspects of land husbandry including the management
                  of biological invasions.},

                  ecologists have sought to explain differences in
                  local diversity by the influence of the physical
                  environment on local interactions among species,
                  interactions that are generally believed to limit
                  the number of coexisting species. But diversity of
                  the biological community often fails to converge
                  under similar physical conditions, and local
                  diversity bears a demonstrable dependence upon
                  regional diversity. These observations suggest that
                  regional and historical processes, as well as unique
                  events and circumstances, profoundly influence local
                  community structure. Ecologists must broaden their
                  concepts of community processes and incorporate data
                  from systematics, biogeography, and paleontology
                  into analyses of ecological patterns and tests of

                  the use of smoke as a fire analogue for ecological
                  research remain limited. The role of season of
                  treatment in the efficacy of smoke as a promotive
                  germination agent was investigated over two growing
                  seasons using natural soil stored seedbanks in
                  Banksia woodland near Perth, Western
                  Australia. Smoke was applied to unburnt sites in the
                  autumn, winter and spring of 1994. Germinant
                  emergence and seedling survival of 37 species
                  representing 18 families was monitored in both
                  unburnt sites and in adjacent, recently burnt sites
                  until the second spring after treatment (October
                  1995). Recruitment from seed was found to be
                  profoundly affected by the season in which dormancy
                  breaking treatment had been applied. The promotive
                  effect extended beyond the initial year of
                  application. For the majority of the species
                  investigated, application of smoke to unburnt sites
                  in autumn promoted a significantly greater
                  germination response than treatment in winter or
                  spring. In only three cases (introduced annuals, the
                  Fabaceae and Hibbertia amplexicaulis) did autumn
                  smoke treatment not yield better germination than in
                  summer-burnt counterparts. However, in almost half
                  of the cases examined, proportions of seedlings
                  surviving past their first summer after emergence in
                  burnt areas were consistently greater than those in
                  smoked or untreated sites. Most notably, no
                  seedlings emerging during the spring of the first
                  year of study survived into the following
                  summer. Implications of the results with respect to

                  in large roots and lower boles of the tropical

                  30-day period following mechanical shoot
                  removal. The degree of damage was based on amounts
                  typically destroyed by Hypsipyla grandella, a
                  serious lepidopteran pest of C. odorata. From
                  14-month-old plantations at La Selva Biological
                  Station, Costa Rica, three treatments were
                  established based on the length of shoot and number
                  of leaves removed: controls (no tissue removed),
                  moderate damage, and severe damage. Initial starch
                  concentrations were compared with concentrations
                  observed 18 to 30 days following shoot removal using
                  enzymatic starch hydrolysis and colorimetry. Root
                  starch concentrations increased in undamaged trees,
                  decreased slightly in the moderately damaged trees,
                  and decreased markedly in severely damaged trees
                  during the sampling period. Starch concentrations in
                  lower boles did not decrease following shoot damage,
                  suggesting a specific role of root search reserves
                  in responding to aboveground carbon
                  requirements. The dry weights of regrown shoots were
                  similar for the moderately and severely damaged
                  trees, but severely damaged trees produced numerous
                  basal shoots while moderately damaged trees produced
                  only one or two terminal shoots near the point of
                  excision. Decreases in root search concentrations
                  following shoot damage and rapid shoot regrowth

                  C. odorata might provide a survival mechanism after

                  has long-lived individual trees that can reproduce
                  both sexually and asexually. Allozyme markers
                  indicate that, in old-growth populations in northern
                  California, 15-34% of clones are multistemmed. Of
                  those, they have few stems per clone, and none are
                  very spatially pervasive. There is much variety in
                  the clonal configurations observed, including
                  circular, linear, and (or) disjunct
                  arrangements. Visual assessment is a poor predictor
                  of clonal identity and fairy ring structures more
                  often than not contain multiple genotypes. In this
                  first allozyme study of coast redwood, high levels
                  of genetic variation are observed, higher than those
                  observed for most other western conifers. These
                  levels are perhaps related to the species' hexaploid
                  condition, ancient phylogenetic lineage, and
                  historically broader natural range. There are also
                  generally high levels of genotypic diversity. Upland
                  sites, with more frequent and intense fires, do not
                  differ significantly in genotypic diversity from the
                  more mesic lowland sites. Population structure in
                  coast redwood seems to resemble the classic pattern
                  for many open-pollinated conifers: much diversity
                  within and little among populations. However, this
                  is not a rangewide study. The current levels and
                  structure of genetic and genotypic diversity in
                  old-growth populations suggests episodic
                  recruitment. The long-lived nature of individual
                  stems and the capacity for asexual reproduction may
                  allow clones to exist indefinitely, thus challenging
                  some of the generalizations in evolutionary theory

  abstract =     {This study explored the determinants of spread of
                  four alien Pinus species and the ability of models
                  to predict invasion dynamics in a complex fragmented
                  landscape. The role of environmental factors,
                  natural and anthropogenic disturbance in relation to
                  invasion history was assessed for different stages
                  in the invasion process using a Geographic
                  Information System. Pines escaped from plantations
                  over the past 30 years and spread into the natural
                  semi-arid shrubland (renosterveld). The pattern of
                  spread was compared with a simulated random
                  distribution using two different techniques, a
                  standard logistic regression, and a new recursive
                  modelling approach (Formal Inference-based Recursive
                  Modelling; FIRM). FIRM analysis improved the
                  accuracy of predictions and revealed interactive
                  effects of variables hidden by the logistic
                  regression analysis. More than 80% of isolated pine
                  individuals were found in 20% of the habitat
                  classified as suitable by the models. Soil pH was
                  the most important predictor for the distribution of
                  isolated trees, whereas the establishment of dense
                  pine stands was largely determined by fire
                  history. Differences in invasive behaviour could be
                  explained by species attributes such as limited
                  dispersal for P. canariensis, and better
                  drought-tolerance for P. halepensis. Sixty-five
                  percent of the current pine distribution was
                  accurately predicted by the spatial distribution of
                  the first trees to have invaded. Such models could
                  be used to predict potential spread of invasive
                  plants and gain a better understanding of the main
                  factors driving the invasion process. However, the
                  spread of invasive species in fragmented landscapes,
                  strongly modified by human activities, is very
                  complicated, and the spread remains difficult to
                  predict in the long term. The dynamics of invasion
                  are discussed in relation to changes in land use and
                  disturbance regime.},

  abstract =     {Jack pine is an important species for planting and
                  direct, seeding in the Lake States (USA) and
                  throughout much of the boreal forest of Canada. It
                  is highly variable in climatic adaptation, growth,
                  and form and exhibits great genetic diversity of
                  silvicultural significance. Within its natural range
                  jack pine grows in diverse climatic conditions and
                  on a wide variety of sites. Planting of jack pine in
                  the past was largely on sites too poor to support
                  merchantable timber production of other
                  species. Planting jack pine on the poorest sites was
                  not always justifiable. On short rotations and good
                  soil, locally adapted jack pine produces a higher
                  volume of wood than do red pine or other sympatric
                  species. Nearly all the present range of jack pine
                  was glaciated during the most recent Wisconsin
                  stage. Thus, the present distribution of the species
                  results from reinvasion and migration over great
                  distances in a short time. Jack pine is monoecious
                  with ovulate cones usually occurring in the upper
                  tree crown and staminate cones in the lower
                  crown. Staminate cone primordia are initiated in
                  early or mid-July and ovulate cone primordia in
                  Aug. Time of wind-pollination varies from year to
                  year, occuring within the period from mid-May to
                  mid-June. Two growing seasons are required for the
                  ovulate cones to mature. The seed is mature and
                  viable in mid-Sept. of the 2nd growing season. Cone
                  and seed production is fairly regular and increases
                  until crowns begin to compete. Over much of its
                  range, jack pine has serotinous, persistent cones,
                  allowing seed to be stored on the tree for several
                  years while retaining its viability. Little seed
                  dormancy is present, and germination is usually
                  rapid. Cuttings taken from young trees cna be
                  rooted, but rooting ability decreases rapidly as the
                  ortet age increases. Needles fascicles, in which the
                  intrafascicular buds are forced to develop by
                  shearing the terminal bud, can also be
                  rooted. Grafting is highly successful in some
                  clones, but graft incompatibility is evident in
                  others. Cell culture and tissue culture have not yet
                  resulted in successful propagation of a complete
                  jack pine tree.},

                  batholith in conjunction with are magmatism is being
                  convectively removed as a "drip" structure. This
                  structure, as imaged seismically, is roughly
                  cylindrical in shape with a diameter of 100 km, and
                  extends to similar to225 km depth. Centered above
                  this structure is a region similar to120 km in
                  diameter that is undergoing active subsidence
                  relative to adjacent regions. Such subsidence is
                  seen in the active fluvial-alluvial sediment
                  flooding of mountainous topography of the
                  southwestern Sierra and in the development of the
                  adjacent Tulare Lake basin of the San Joaquin
                  Valley. Dynamic modeling of such upper-mantle drip
                  structures predicts a phase of overlying surface
                  subsidence during the most vigorous phase of drip
                  formation. The southern Sierra upper mantle drip and
                  the overlying crust appear to be in this phase of
                  their dynamically coupled evolution.},

  abstract =     {In a classical paper, Hutchinson (1961) argued that
                  the large number of species in most plankton
                  communities is remarkable in view of the competitive
                  exclusion principle, which suggests that in
                  homogeneous, well-mixed environments species that
                  compete for the same resources cannot coexist. Few
                  ideas in aquatic ecology have evoked more research
                  than this 'paradox of the plankton'. This review is
                  an effort to put the main solutions to the paradox
                  that have been proposed over the years into
                  perspective. Hutchinson himself already suggested
                  that the explanation could be that plankton
                  communities are not in equilibrium at all due to
                  weather-driven fluctuations. Subsequent research
                  confirmed that such externally imposed variability
                  can allow many species to coexist. Another important
                  point is that in practice the homogeneous well-mixed
                  conditions assumed in the competitive exclusion
                  principle hardly exist. Even the open ocean, for
                  instance, has a spatial complexity resulting from
                  meso-scale vortices and fronts that can facilitate
                  coexistence of species. Perhaps most excitingly,
                  theoretical work on species interactions has given a
                  counter-intuitive new dimension to the understanding
                  of diversity. Various competition and predation
                  models suggest that even in homogeneous and constant
                  environments plankton will never settle to
                  equilibrium. Instead, interactions between multiple
                  species may give rise to oscillations and chaos,
                  with a continuous wax and wane of species within the
                  community. Long-term laboratory experiments support
                  this view. This chaotic behavior implies among other
                  things that plankton dynamics are intrinsically
                  unpredictable in the long run when viewed in
                  detail. Nonetheless, on a higher aggregation level,
                  indicators such as total algal biomass may show
                  quite regular patterns.},

  abstract =     {We studied plant survival and colonization over an
                  experimental gradient, from fire lightly scorching
                  the soil to fire consuming most of the organic soil
                  layer, at two forest sites in northern Sweden. The
                  gradient was achieved by adding different amounts of
                  fuel to small plots that were burned in 1988 and
                  1989. Temperature was recorded at four soil strata
                  during burning. We analyzed survival of seeds and
                  rhizomes in the soil immediately after fire, and
                  followed vegetation cover and seedling establishment
                  until 1993. During fire, there was a steep decline
                  in maximum temperature with increasing depth below
                  the char, irrespective of the depth of burn in the
                  mor layer, indicating that burn depth can be used as
                  a general indicator of heat impact below
                  ground. Lethal temperature was not recorded deeper
                  than 20-30 mm under the burn boundary. Plant
                  survival was determined both by depth of burn and by
                  depth distribution of regenerative structures in the
                  soil. Three rhizomatous species, the dwarf shrubs
                  Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea and
                  the grass Deschampsia flexuosa, were dominant in the
                  prefire vegetation. For all three species, the bulk
                  of the soil bud bank was located within the mor
                  layer, but was more superficial for
                  D. flexuosa. Initial mortality in the bud bank was
                  progressively higher with increasing depth of burn,
                  and this determined the regrowth over the following
                  years. After fires that consumed only the moss
                  layer, cover of the Vaccinium species returned to
                  prefire levels within 2-4 yr, and D. flexuosa showed
                  a dramatic increase in cover as well as in
                  fruiting. Fires that burned slightly deeper nearly
                  eliminated D. flexuosa, and the deepest burning
                  fires also eliminated Vaccinium spp. In contrast to
                  regrowth from rhizomes, colonization from seed was
                  better after relatively deep-burning fire, both for
                  species with a soil seed bank and for species
                  dispersing seed onto the burnt soil. However, after
                  fires consuming most of the organic soil layer, seed
                  bank species were also badly affected, whereas
                  dispersers showed progressively better establishment
                  with increasing depth of burn. Differences between
                  treatments were still great after 5 yr, indicating
                  that variation in depth of burn will have a
                  long-lasting impact on the vegetation. These results
                  from experimentally burned plots were corroborated
                  by an analysis of depth distribution of viable plant
                  rhizomes and seeds, and the initial colonization at
                  a site newly burned in a wildfire. The precise
                  response patterns of boreal vegetation to variation
                  in burn depth will depend on characteristics of the
                  species present. However, we assume that these
                  results have a high degree of generality, since, in
                  podzolized soils, most rhizomatous species are
                  predominantly located in the mor layer, since the
                  dormant seed bank typically is concentrated at the
                  interface of mor and mineral soil, and also since a
                  thick organic soil layer is a poor seedbed for
                  incoming seeds. The results indicate that in boreal
                  forest, depth of burn is a more important variable
                  than fire front intensity for the understory
                  vegetation, in contrast to the situation in
                  ecosystems with little accumulation of organic
                  material on the mineral soil.},

                  predictions about the timing and ordering of
                  character state changes through history. These
                  theories are testable by ''reconstructing'' ancestor
                  states using phylogenetic trees and measurements of
                  contemporary species. Here we use maximum likelihood
                  to estimate and evaluate the accuracy of ancestor
                  reconstructions. We present likelihoods of discrete
                  ancestor states and derive probability distributions
                  for continuous ancestral traits. The methods are
                  applied to several examples: diets of ancestral
                  Darwin's finches; origin of inquilinism in gall
                  wasps; microhabitat partitioning and body size
                  evolution in scrubwrens; digestive enzyme evolution
                  in artiodactyl mammals; origin of a sexually
                  selected male trait, the sword, in platies and
                  swordtails; and evolution of specialization in
                  Anolis lizards. When changes between discrete
                  character states are rare, the maximum likelihood
                  results are similar to parsimony estimates. In this
                  case the accuracy of estimates is often high, with
                  the exception of some nodes deep in the tree. If
                  change is frequent then reconstructions are highly
                  uncertain, especially of distant ancestors. Ancestor
                  states for continuous traits are typically highly
                  uncertain. We conclude that measures of uncertainty
                  are useful and should always be provided, despite
                  simplistic assumptions about the probabilistic
                  models that underlie them. If uncertainty is too
                  high, reconstruction should be abandoned in favor of
                  approaches that fit different models of trait
                  evolution to species data and phylogenetic trees,
                  taking into account the range of ancestor states
                  permitted by the data.},

                  seed non-native grasses onto burned slopes. To
                  assess how post-fire seeding affects plant recovery,
                  we compared areas that were either unseeded or
                  artificially seeded after high-intensity fire in a
                  dry Abies grandis (Dougl.) Lindl. forest in the
                  northeastern Cascades. Seeding with a mix of
                  non-native grasses and a legume significantly
                  reduced the cover of native plants and shifted
                  patterns of relative abundance after 2
                  years. Although seeding did not significantly affect
                  total cover or native species richness, it reduced
                  overall native plant cover by 47%. Species that
                  recolonize via wind-dispersed seeds (e.g., Epilobium
                  angustifolium L., Lactuca serriola L., and Arenaria
                  macrophylla Hook.), species with long-lived seeds
                  that germinate after fire (e.g., Ceanothus velutinus
                  Dougl.), and species with wide successional
                  amplitudes that resprout after fire (e.g., Apocynum
                  androsaemifolium L. and Salix scouleriana Barratt)
                  all declined steeply in cover on seeded plots. In
                  addition, conifer seedlings were only half as
                  abundant on seeded plots. As seeding after fire does
                  not boost total plant cover and limits conifer tree
                  establishment on the study area, it appears to do
                  little to reduce the risk of soil erosion. It also
                  appears to inhibit native shrub and herb
                  re-establishment. These substantial effects on
                  native species appear to alter plant communities
                  well beyond the life of the seeded species.},

                  through its direct effects by killing or wounding
                  susceptible individuals and through its effect on
                  the environment: the post-fire environment may
                  select specific physiological traits or life
                  histories. We used phylogenetic independent
                  contrasts to test the hypothesis that fire has
                  selected for correlated evolution among alternative
                  suites of traits in pines: a survival/avoidance
                  suite characterized by thick bark, height, and self
                  pruning of dead branches; and a fire-embracing
                  strategy in which plants invest little into
                  survival, exhibit traits which enhance flammability,
                  and use fire as a means to cue seedling
                  establishment to the post-fire environment through
                  serotinous cones. We created a set of alternative
                  "supertree" phylogenies for the genus Pinus from
                  published sources. Using these alternative
                  phylogenies, published ecological data for 38 pine
                  species (Keeley and Zedler 1998), and newly
                  collected morphological data, we demonstrate that
                  much variation in trait evolution occurs along a
                  fire surviving/fire embracing axis. Pines vary in
                  their susceptibility to ignition since a tree that
                  retains dead branches is more likely to carry a fire
                  into the canopy than a tree that self-prunes. The
                  evolution of increased flammability may have altered
                  evolutionary trajectories prompting an evolutionary
                  switch from a fire-surviving to a fire-embracing
                  life history. Alternatively, the fire-embracing
                  strategy may in fact select for increased
                  flammability to ensure canopy ignition and the
                  realization of serotinous seed-release.},

                  accepted generalization regarding patterns of
                  species diversity, but may not hold true where fire
                  is the disturbance. In the Mediterranean-climate
                  shrublands of South Africa, called fynbos, fire is
                  the most importance disturbance and a controlling
                  factor in community dynamics. The intermediate

                  disturbance frequencies. Measures of diversity are

                  richness for three fire regimes in South African

                  disturbance frequency was opposite that predicted by
                  the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. At the
                  largest spatial scales, species diversity was
                  highest at the least frequently burned sites (40
                  years between fires) and lowest at the sites of
                  moderate (15 to 26 years between fires) and high
                  fire frequency (alternating four and six year fire
                  cycle). Community heterogeneity, measured both as
                  the slope of the species-area curve for a site and
                  as the mean dissimilarity in species composition
                  among subplots within a site, correlated with
                  species diversity at the largest spatial
                  scales. Community heterogeneity was highest at the
                  least frequently burned sites and lowest at the
                  sites that experienced an intermediate fire
                  frequency.},

                  the savanna grass Andropogon semiberbis,
                  sized-classified matrix population models were
                  constructed for an annually burnt population and for
                  a population protected from fire. These models were
                  used to examine the effects of fire on population
                  growth rate, stable size distributions and
                  reproductive value, and to simulate different fire
                  regimes. (2) The burnt population is capable of
                  increasing rapidly (.LAMBDA.1 = 1.2524, r = 0.2251),
                  whereas the unburnt, population is unable to persist
                  (.lambda.1 = 0.2762, r =- 1.2886). Most of this
                  difference is due to effects on the growth, survival
                  and reproduction of the smallest two size classes,
                  which are shown by elasticity analysis to be the
                  most important to population growth in both
                  populations. The stable size distributions and
                  reproductive values are similar in the two
                  populations. (3) Both deterministic and stochastic
                  analyses reveal a critical frequency of fire
                  (.apprxeq. 0.85) below which this species is unable
                  to maintain itself. This apparent reliance on fire
                  frequency suggests that the spread and evolution of
                  this species has been closely related to human
                  occupation of neotropical savannas.},

  abstract =     {Ecologists have often compared ecological
                  communities in different areas, for example on
                  different continents. The main interest is that the
                  communities might be more similar in the characters
                  of their species than expected under a null model of
                  random species assortment. We suggest that such a
                  null model should be based only on the species
                  observed across the samples. Species-level
                  convergence and community-level convergence must be
                  distinguished. Physical filters (limitation to
                  growth by the physical environment) can give
                  species-level convergence, but only biotic filtering
                  (based on species interactions) can give
                  community-level convergence. Matching to species and
                  species mutual matching must also be distinguished;
                  the process is different, but the same tests work
                  for both. Evolutionary convergence and ecological
                  convergence have been distinguished in the past, but
                  there is little value in this distinction. Even if
                  evolutionary character separation is occurring, the
                  selection involved must be based on ecological
                  sorting, by elimination of genotypes that are too
                  similar. Although ecotypes can be distinguished, the
                  results of evolution by whole species are impossible
                  to distinguish, by present-day observation, from
                  those of ecological sorting. Fortunately, tests for
                  present-day evidence of evolution also work for
                  ecological sorting, and vice-versa. Contrary to
                  suggestions that community convergence is
                  untestable, valid tests do exist, They have already
                  produced some evidence of convergence, but evidence
                  that community-level convergence is a common and
                  general phenomenon remains to be produced. },

  abstract =     {Over the last two decades, although much has been
                  learned regarding the multifaceted nature of
                  biodiversity, relatively little is known regarding
                  spatial variation in constituents other than species
                  richness. This is particularly true along extensive
                  environmental gradients such as latitude. Herein, we
                  describe latitudinal gradients in the functional
                  diversity of New World bat communities. Bat species
                  from each of 32 communities were assigned to one of
                  seven functional groups. Latitudinal gradients
                  existed for the richness, diversity and
                  scaled-dominance of functional groups. No
                  significant patterns were observed for evenness of
                  functional groups. Measures of functional diversity
                  were different in magnitude and increased towards
                  the equator at a faster rate than expected given the
                  underlying spatial variation in species
                  richness. Thus, latitudinal gradient in species
                  richness alone do not cause the latitudinal gradient
                  in functional diversity. When variation in species
                  composition of the regional fauna of each community
                  was incorporated into analyses, many differences
                  between observed and simulated patterns of
                  functional diversity were not significant. This
                  suggests that those processes that determine the
                  composition of regional faunas strongly influence
                  the latitudinal gradient in functional diversity at
                  the local level. Nonetheless, functional diversity
                  was lower than expected across observed
                  sites. Community-wide responses to variation in the
                  quantity and quality of resources at the local level
                  probably contribute to differences in functional
                  diversity at local and regional scales and enhance
                  beta diversity.},

                  gene sequences in 268 trees derived from 19 natural
                  populations of three species of pines from
                  California (USA): Monterey pine (Pinus radiata
                  D. Don), bishop pine (P. muricata D. Don), and
                  knobcone pine (P. attenuata Lemm.). Total genomic
                  DNA was digested with four restriction endonucleases
                  and probed with a 750-bp fragment of the
                  mitochondrial coxI gene amplified from P. attenuata
                  via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The coxI
                  gene is repeated at least 4 times in some
                  populations, and all variants that we observed
                  resulted from complex rearrangements rather than
                  from point mutations. There was limited
                  intrapopulation variation, but strong
                  differentiation among populations. When applied to
                  haplotype frequencies, Nei's gene diversity within
                  populations (H(s)) averaged 7 % (+/- 3), and G(st)

                  differentiation for mtDNA suggests that it can be a
                  powerful marker of population differences, but its
                  rapid rate of structural evolution appears to result
                  from recombination among a limited number of

                  fragment phenotypes. The phylogenetic trees

                  vegetation in these openings. Many causes for the
                  lack of herb growth in gaps have been postulated,
                  including lack of seeds in the soil, limited
                  nutrients and water, competition with shrubs for
                  resources, interference competition (i.e.,
                  allelopathy), and herbivory. An experiment was
                  conducted to assess the individual and combined
                  effects of four main factors (trenching to reduce
                  root competition, caging to reduce herbivory,
                  nutrient addition, and water addition) on herb
                  germination,survival, and growth in chaparral

                  found strong interactions among these
                  treatments. Therefore, no single factor can be
                  regarded as causing the absence of herbs in
                  chaparral. Herb establishment was limited by
                  herbivory and root competition with shrubs for
                  limited nutrients and/or water. Survival was
                  enhanced by trenching, caging, and water. Growth was
                  enhanced by nutrient addition, but the magnitude of
                  this nutrient effect became appreciable only within
                  trenched, caged plots. The vegetative cover of
                  annual herbs in gaps was limited by the combined
                  effects of herbivory, competition with the roots of
                  shrubs, inadequate nutrients, and inadequate water.},

                  heterogeneity in frequently burned plant
                  communities. We hypothesized that variation in fire

                  loads produces heterogeneity in pine savanna ground
                  cover by altering shrub abundance. To test this
                  hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated prefire
                  fuel loads to mimic naturally occurring fuel-load
                  heterogeneity associated with branch falls, needle
                  fall near large pines, and animal disturbances in a
                  frequently burned longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
                  savanna in Louisiana, USA. We applied one of four
                  fuel treatments (unaltered control, fine-fuel
                  removal, fine-fuel addition, wood addition) to each
                  of 540 (1-m(2)) quadrats prior to growing-season
                  prescribed fires in each of two years (1999 and
                  2001). In both years fuel addition increased (and
                  fuel removal decreased) fuel Consumption and maximum
                  fire temperatures relative to unaltered
                  controls. Fuel addition, particularly wood,
                  increased damage to shrubs, increased shrub
                  mortality, and decreased resprout density relative
                  to controls. We propose that local variation in fire
                  intensity may contribute to maintenance of high
                  species diversity in pine savannas by reducing shrub
                  abundance and creating openings in an otherwise

  abstract =     {An unresolved discussion in contemporary ecology
                  deals with the relative importance of competition
                  along environmental gradients. In deserts,
                  local-scale differences in environmental
                  productivity may be caused by the presence of
                  shrubs, which represent a favorable habitat for
                  annual populations within a nutrient-poor matrix. In
                  this study, we attempted to test the hypothesis that
                  facilitation of desert annuals by shrubs increase
                  the intensity of competition among the annual
                  plants. Such negative indirect effects have so far
                  been ignored in studies about plant-plant
                  interactions. We tested our hypothesis by measuring
                  seedling survival and fecundity of four abundant
                  annual plant species with and without neighbors in
                  open areas and under shrub canopies in a sandy
                  desert area. Our findings did not indicate indirect
                  negative effects of shrubs on their understory
                  annuals. Sensitivity to the presence of neighbors
                  varied between species and surprisingly, the species
                  with the smallest seeds was the only one which was
                  not negatively affected by the presence of
                  neighbors. In contrast to our hypothesis, there was
                  no difference between the habitat types shrubs and
                  openings in absolute and relative competition
                  intensity. Our overall results suggest that negative
                  indirect effects of shrubs are unimportant in
                  determining demographic response of understory
                  annual plants.},

  abstract =     {Recently, numerous studies have pointed to the
                  importance of positive interactions in natural
                  communities. There is now a broad consensus that the
                  balance between negative and positive interactions
                  should shift along environmental gradients, with
                  competition prevailing under environmentally benign
                  conditions and positive interactions dominating
                  under harsh conditions. A commonly cited example of
                  the importance of facilitation in harsh environments
                  is the preference of desert annual plants for the
                  areas under the canopy of shrubs. The recognition of
                  apparently positive effects of desert shrubs on
                  annuals, however, has been mostly based on density
                  measurements, while fitness parameters of the
                  understory plants have been ignored. Also, the
                  temporal consistency of such effects has not been
                  previously tested. Based on conceptual ideas about
                  the balance between interference and facilitation,
                  we predicted that positive effects of the shrubs on
                  the understory should dominate in dry years, while
                  in favorable years, negative effects would be
                  stronger. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the
                  direction and magnitude of the shrub effect on
                  demographic responses of four desert annual plant
                  species during four consecutive seasons of differing
                  rainfall. The results contradicted our initial
                  hypothesis. Depending on the species, the effect of
                  the shrubs shifted from either negative to neutral
                  or from neutral to positive with increasing annual
                  rainfall. However, this trend was stronger for the
                  effect of shrubs on plant reproductive success than
                  on their densities. Our data highlight the
                  importance of measuring fitness parameters in
                  studies of plant-plant interactions. We suggest that
                  the negative effects of shrubs on plant fitness were
                  due to rainfall interception, while positive effects
                  were related to increased nutrient availability
                  beneath shrubs. However, the mechanisms by which the
                  shrubs and annuals interact can only be resolved
                  using an experimental approach. Our results
                  contradict previous hypotheses about the relative
                  importance of positive and negative interactions
                  along environmental gradients. A simple conceptual
                  model summarizing the proposed role of rainfall in
                  determining the direction of shrub effects on their
                  understory annuals is presented.},

                  outside the envelope within which many of the
                  terrestrial plants of a region evolved. These
                  environmental modifications might become a greater
                  cause of global species extinction than direct
                  habitat destruction. The environmental constraints
                  undergoing human modification include levels of soil
                  nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and pH, atmospheric
                  CO2, herbivore, pathogen, and predator densities,
                  disturbance regimes, and climate. Extinction would
                  occur because the physiologies, morphologies, and
                  life histories of plants limit each species to being
                  a superior competitor for a particular combination
                  of environmental constraints. Changes in these
                  constraints would favor a few species that would
                  competitively displace many other species from a
                  region. In the long-term, the "weedy" taxa that
                  became the dominants of the novel conditions imposed
                  by global change should become the progenitors of a
                  series of new species that are progressively less
                  weedy and better adapted to the new conditions. The
                  relative importance of evolutionary versus community
                  ecology responses to global environmental change
                  would depend on the extent of regional and local
                  recruitment limitation, and on whether the suite of
                  human-imposed constraints were novel just regionally
                  or on continental or global scales.},

                  species were added to patches of native
                  grassland. Four field seasons after a one-time
                  addition of seed, many added species were still
                  present and reproducing, with plots seeded at the
                  highest rate having species richness that was 83%
                  greater and total plant cover that was 31% greater
                  than controls. Total plant community cover increased
                  significantly with the number of species added as
                  seed, but total cover of pre-existing species was
                  independent of the number of species added as seed,
                  suggesting that the new species mainly filled
                  previously ''empty'' sites. The proportion of added
                  species that became established was negatively
                  correlated with initial species richness of plots,
                  suggesting that species-rich sites were more
                  resistant to invasion. Plot invasibility also
                  depended on the abundances and species richness of
                  plant functional groups in the plots, but was
                  independent of seed size and of total plant
                  cover. The major functional groups of plants
                  differed in their abilities to invade as seed, with
                  perennial grasses being the poorest invaders and
                  herbaceous legumes being the best. Thus, local
                  biotic interactions and recruitment dynamics jointly
                  determined diversity, species composition, and
                  species abundances in these native grassland
                  communities. This supports a metapopulation-like
                  perspective over a purely interspecific-interaction
                  perspective or a purely regional perspective,
                  suggesting that recruitment limitation may be more
                  important, even on a local scale, than often
                  recognized.},

                  and Saddle Mountain burns of western Montana 26 and
                  28 years, respectively, after fire. Pinus albicaulis
                  seeds are dispersed primarily by Clark's nutcracker
                  (Nucifraga columbiana Wilson) in caches of 1-15 or
                  more seeds. Consequently, P. albicaulis seedlings
                  and trees often occur in clusters. In the Sleeping
                  Child burn we collected regeneration data from 63
                  quadrats along a 3.6-km transect and from 14
                  quadrats along a 20.6-km road transect; in the
                  Saddle Mountain burn we collected data from 41
                  quadrats along a 3.2-km transect. We determined
                  regression models for height versus age and age
                  versus height relationships for P. albicaulis and
                  Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. and used the latter
                  regression models to construct regeneration age
                  structures for both bums. For both conifers a
                  disproportionately high percentage of regeneration
                  was established between 1977 and 1985, about 17-25
                  years after fire. Thus, major regeneration was
                  episodic. A small increase in mean seasonal rainfall
                  between 1977 and 1985 possibly contributed to this
                  recruitment surge. Age differences of 1-8 years
                  occurred among seedlings in 65-86% of the seedling
                  and tree clusters sampled, suggesting delayed
                  germination of some cached seeds. Pinus albicaulis
                  regeneration was more frequently associated with
                  Vaccinium scoparium Leiberg and less frequently
                  associated with Xerophyllum tenax (Pursh) Nutt. and
                  Luzula hitchcockii Hamet-Ahti relative to the

                  wildfires on the same sites over a period of 50
                  years in the ''Massif des Aspres'' (southern
                  France). The study was carried out in areas occupied
                  by Quercus suber and Q. ilex series. A comparison of
                  historical and cartographical documents (vegetation
                  maps covering a 50 year interval and an accurate map
                  of major wildfires during this period) allowed us to
                  determine the changes occurring over time with or
                  without fire action. Plant communities were grouped
                  into three main vegetation types: forests, treed
                  shrublands and shrublands. The passage of three
                  successive wildfires on the same site led to a
                  decrease in forest areas and an increase in
                  shrublands; however, shrublands were already present
                  before the first fire of the period under
                  consideration. Less frequent fire occurrence induced
                  more complex heterogeneity and greater landscape
                  diversity. In the study region as a whole, with or
                  without fire action, a significant decrease in
                  forest surfaces was recorded, whereas there was an
                  increase of unforested communities such as treed
                  shrublands and shrublands. In some parts of the
                  Massif fires increased the homogeneity of the
                  landscape, in other parts they created a greater
                  heterogeneity and diversity of plant communities.},

                  prairies and Garry oak woodlands on Fort Lewis. Fire
                  exclusion in the 1900s, however, has allowed Scot's
                  broom, Douglas fir,and numerous herbaceous aliens to
                  invade native prairies and oak woadlands. Since
                  1978, a management program using prescribed fires on
                  3-5 yr rotations has been used in an effort to
                  maintain the open communities. We evaluated the role
                  of fire on fescue prairies, oak woodlands, and broom
                  thickets using prescribed fires in fall 1994 and
                  spring 1995, and compared preburn/postburn species
                  frequency to identify fire maintainers, increasers,
                  and decreasers. Fall fires were more effective than
                  spring fires, and best promoted native species and
                  communities. Prescribed fires had no effect on Idaho
                  fescue frequency, which maintained dominance in the
                  postfire prairie. Other native prairie graminoids
                  and forbs, and hairy cats-ear, a prominent alien,
                  were maintained by fire. Prescribed fires also
                  maintained open Garry oak woodlands, reduced Scot's
                  broom cover in broom thickets. and killed small
                  Douglas-firs. These fires, however, tended to favor
                  alien species instead of native species. A large
                  prairie subjected to >50 yr of broadcast burns
                  ignited annually by artillery fire has been
                  converted from fescue prairie to an open meadow
                  dominated by hairy cats-ear and alien grasses, such
                  as sweet vernal grass. Of the three regimes we
                  investigated, fire intervals shorter or longer than
                  the 3-5 yr fire rotation now employed on Fort Lewis
                  are detrimental to fescue prairie and oak
                  woodland. Excessive burning or fire exclusion causes

  abstract =     {Zigadenus fremontii is often a striking component of
                  the flora following fire in the chaparral. Like
                  other geophytes, it produces large numbers of
                  flowers in the first spring after a burn. Although
                  these plants are most conspicuous in the early
                  postfire environment, the question that remains is,
                  how do they persist in the interval between fires?
                  To address this we investigated differences in the
                  growth and reproduction of Z. fremontii in burned
                  and unburned chaparral. We monitored marked
                  individuals for nine years at three sites: two that
                  were burned in 1990 and one in the same area that
                  was in unburned mature chaparral. We measured leaf
                  area, and production of flowers and fruits. We also
                  conducted seed experiments in the field to determine
                  the rates and timing of germination. We found that
                  reproduction occurs only in the immediate postfire
                  period: flowering and production of fruits and seeds
                  in the first year following fire, and seedling
                  establishment by year 3. There was a cost of
                  reproduction; plants that flowered (in the burn
                  area) had negative growth rates the following
                  year. In contrast, plants in unburned chaparral,
                  which did not flower, had positive growth rates over
                  the same period. Moreover, plants that produced the
                  most flowers had the lowest growth rates. In the
                  unburned chaparral site, plants were not dormant as
                  predicted from previous literature; instead they
                  produced leaves nearly every year. In most years the
                  average leaf area per plant was greater than that in
                  the burned sites. Our results indicate that postfire
                  reproduction depends on growth and carbohydrate
                  storage in the inter-fire period. We also suggest
                  that this species is relatively long-lived for a
                  herbaceous perennial.},

                  through its role in the recovery of a burnt
                  shrubland. The study was carried out in a heathland
                  characterized by several ericaceous species. Part of
                  the heathland was burnt in a wildfire on 7 April
                  1991, while the rest was not affected by the fire
                  and used as a control. Soil samples were collected
                  three days after the wildfire, in the absence of
                  rain; 10 samples (20x25 cm width to a depth of 5 cm)
                  were collected from the burnt area and 10 from the
                  control. Samples were set out in a greenhouse where
                  germinating seedlings were recorded, counted and
                  identified for 17 months. Observations were also
                  carried out twice in the field for 14 months after
                  the wildfire by examining two permanent transects in
                  the study area and recording all regenerating
                  species. The results show a low correspondence
                  between soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation:
                  only 23% of the identified taxa appeared both in the
                  bank and in the field observations. From these
                  species 65% of them have dispersal types like
                  autochory or barochory, that is they generally fall
                  near the mother plant. In the identified species as
                  a whole, therophytes and hemicryptophytes dominate
                  in comparison with chamaephytes, phanerophytes and
                  geophytes; this also applied to the herbaceous
                  species in comparison with the woody
                  ones. Potentially soil possesses an important seed
                  bank, which contributes poorly to the vegetation

                  adaptations to mediterranean climates and analyzed

                  considering a tropical spiny shrubland as the

                  number of species that resprouted after a fire
                  occurred in 1995 and a distribution map of the
                  evergreen sclerophyllous vegetation in Mexico
                  (mexical) under nonmediterranean climates. The

                  Australia, and the Mediterranean Basin, according to
                  a correspondence analysis, which ordinated the
                  Tehuacan mexical closer to the mediterranean areas
                  than to the external group. All the vegetation and

                  communities (Australia, California and South Africa)
                  have led to the prediction that seedlings of seeders
                  grow faster than those of resprouters. In the
                  Mediterranean Basin, it has also been hypothesized
                  that regeneration strategy of plants after fire is
                  associated with several other life history

                  dominant plants in the Mediterranean Basin from
                  literature data. Results show that seeders from the
                  Mediterranean Basin grow significantly faster and

                  fire is that species can be clearly classified as
                  sprouters or non-sprouters. We aimed to assess: (1)
                  how well this dichotomous classification
                  (sprouter/non-sprouter) described the responses of a
                  semi-arid flora to experimental disturbance; (2) how
                  similar were sprouting responses to treatments
                  mimicking intense herbivory and fire; (3) how well
                  easily-measured traits could predict
                  sprouting. Sprouting was assessed for 45 species
                  from a range of growth forms (grasses, forbs,
                  sub-shrubs, woody shrubs and trees) from semi-arid
                  south-eastern Australia. We used two treatments:
                  clipping at stem base, and clipping followed by
                  burning with a blowtorch. A dichotomy accounted for
                  >60% of deviance explained by species
                  identity. Models with three or four groups were not
                  substantially better. The dichotomy was not between
                  0% and 100% sprouting, rather between 'weak' and
                  'strong' sprouters. Probabilities of sprouting for
                  weak sprouters were 23% after clipping and 6% after
                  burning, while strong sprouters had sprouting
                  probabilities of 90% after clipping and 79% after
                  burning. While sprouting varied in space and time,
                  the dichotomy was robust to this
                  variation. Sprouting ability increased with size in
                  most of the species with variable
                  sprouting. Sprouting was partially related to growth
                  form; grasses sprouted strongly, chenopods weakly,
                  and forb and woody species covered the range of
                  sprouting. Strong sprouters were likely to have more
                  stems per plant, greater basal area, shorter
                  potential height and deeper buds than weak
                  sprouters. A hierarchical model that used growth
                  form and then stems-per-plant provided a simple,
                  robust predictor of sprouting. Four-fifths of
                  species responded consistently to clipping and
                  burning while one-fifth of species were strong
                  sprouters after clipping but weak sprouters after
                  burning. Burning reduced sprouting most in
                  intermediate sprouters. Differences between
                  sprouting after clipping and burning reflected
                  increased intensity and were related to the depth of
                  buds below ground.},

                  positive feedback between the expansion of the
                  tussock grass Ampelodesmos mauritanica (hereafter

                  population structure was analysed by surveying
                  stands burned at different fire frequencies. The
                  effect of vegetation dominated by Ampelodesmos on
                  fire behaviour compared to other species coexisting
                  in the community was predicted by the Rothermel fire
                  propagation model BEHAVE. There was a negative
                  correlation between pine cover and percentage of
                  Ampelodesmos plants. Ampelodesmos mortality after
                  fire is very low. Recently burned stands had a
                  higher proportion of reproductive plants and higher
                  seedling density than unburned stands. The high
                  temperatures reached during fire may kill seeds, the
                  higher seedling recruitment results from fast
                  resprouting and higher seed production of burned
                  plants compared to unburned plants 1 year after
                  fire. Simulations with the BEHAVE fire model predict
                  that Ampelodesmos increases fire intensity and
                  spread because of its high accumulation of fuel load
                  and standing dead material. The results suggest that
                  there is a positive relationship between
                  Ampelodesmos abundance and fire regime which
                  increases the invasive potential of this grass and
                  the fire risk of the community where it

                  propagation model BEHAVE. There was a negative
                  correlation between pine cover and percentage of
                  Ampelodesmos plants. Ampelodesmos mortality after
                  fire is very low. Recently burned stands had a
                  higher proportion of reproductive plants and higher
                  seedling density than unburned stands. The high
                  temperatures reached during fire may kill seeds, the
                  higher seedling recruitment results from fast
                  resprouting and higher seed production of burned
                  plants compared to unburned plants 1 year after
                  fire. Simulations with the BEHAVE fire model predict
                  that Ampelodesmos increases fire intensity and
                  spread because of its high accumulation of fuel load
                  and standing dead material. The results suggest that
                  there is a positive relationship between
                  Ampelodesmos abundance and fire regime which
                  increases the invasive potential of this grass and
                  the fire risk of the community where it
                  dominates. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

                  and disturbance is an important ecological issue. We
                  review studies on plant competition in
                  mediterranean-type plant communities in order to
                  discuss its effect on plant- and plant community
                  structure, to determine the type of competition that
                  takes place and the interaction between competition
                  and effects of fire. Competition can intermittently
                  effect all stages of the plant life cycle. Water and
                  light seem to be the most frequent resources for
                  which plants compete. Competition for nutrients also
                  occurs and seems to be more intense when nutrient
                  availability is high. Plant interference through
                  allelopathy is also important. Competition may also
                  occur after fire but it is not clear if it is less
                  intense than in mature stands. As most of the
                  studies have been carried out in California. More
                  field experiments that combine the effect of
                  competition and fire along with environmental
                  gradients differing in water and nutrient levels
                  should be conducted in other mediterranean regions
                  in order to draw generalizations on the mechanisms
                  of competition in plant communities.},

                  artificially induced by changes in temperature and
                  photoperiod. Nitrogen was supplied at optimum and
                  low rates, and during dormancy, one-half of the
                  plants were decapitated. Starch concentrations in
                  root and stem tissues were determined regularly
                  during shoot extension growth, dormancy and
                  resprouting after dormancy. We used light microscopy
                  (LM) combined with image analysis (IA) to determine
                  the cellular localization and amount of starch in
                  different cell types of stem and root
                  tissues. Chemical analysis confirmed that starch
                  concentrations were lower in plants receiving a
                  high-N supply rate than in plants receiving a low-N
                  supply rate. In all plants, the highest
                  concentration of starch was in the roots. Light
                  microscopy and IA showed that starch accumulated
                  mainly in the phloem and cortical cells of both root
                  and stem tissues. Starch grains were also regularly
                  found in ray parenchyma cells. The amount of starch
                  as well as the size of the grains showed strong
                  seasonal fluctuations. In both roots and stems,
                  starch concentrations were highest during
                  predormancy and lowest during periods of shoot
                  extension growth. At the time of resprouting, root
                  cells of decapitated plants were more depleted of
                  starch than root cells of intact plants, supporting
                  the hypothesis that starch reserves in roots are

                  stems of two congeneric pairs of co-occurring
                  chaparral shrubs. First, since previously published
                  results indicated that Adenostoma sparsifolium
                  (Rosaceae) had greater specific conductivity (k(s)
                  or hydraulic conductivity per xylem transverse area)
                  than A. fasciculatum, it was hypothesized that
                  A. sparsifolium would have greater vessel lumen area
                  per square millimeter of xylem area, and less
                  mechanical strength, than A. fasciculatum. Secondly,
                  since Ceanothus megacarpus (Rhamnaceae) is a
                  non-sprouter (unable to sprout from the root crown
                  following fire or other major disturbance) whereas
                  C. spinosus is a sprouter and thus able to form new
                  stems following disturbance, it was hypothesized
                  that C. megacarpus would have greater mechanical
                  strength, but lower k(s), than C. spinosus. Both
                  hypotheses were supported. Based upon computer-aided
                  image analyses, A. sparsifolium had significantly
                  higher mean and maximum vessel diameters (16.4, 40.5
                  vs. 14.6, 35.7 mu m), a 34% greater percent vessel
                  lumen area, and a two-fold greater measured and
                  theoretical k(s) than A. fasciculatum. This
                  corresponded to 14% lower stem density (wet
                  weight/volume) and less mechanical strength, with a
                  37% lower modulus of elasticity (MOE) and a 30%
                  lower modulus of rupture (MOR) than
                  A. fasciculatum. Similarly, C. spinosus had a
                  significantly higher maximum vessel diameter (52.7
                  vs. 41.8 mu m) and a 92% higher theoretical k(s)
                  (and 43% higher measured k(s)) than
                  C. megacarpus. This corresponded to a 9% lower stem
                  density and 20% lower MOR than for
                  C. megacarpus. Thus, at least within these two
                  congeneric pairs of chaparral shrubs growing
                  together in the same habitat, there may be tradeoffs
                  between mechanical strength and conductive
                  efficiency of the stem xylem which correspond to
                  differences in transport physiology and life history

                  C. spinosus is a sprouter and thus able to form new
                  stems following disturbance, it was hypothesized
                  that C. megacarpus would have greater mechanical
                  strength, but lower k(s), than C. spinosus. Both
                  hypotheses were supported. Based upon computer-aided
                  image analyses, A. sparsifolium had significantly
                  higher mean and maximum vessel diameters (16.4, 40.5
                  vs. 14.6, 35.7 mu m), a 34% greater percent vessel
                  lumen area, and a two-fold greater measured and
                  theoretical k(s) than A. fasciculatum. This
                  corresponded to 14% lower stem density (wet
                  weight/volume) and less mechanical strength, with a
                  37% lower modulus of elasticity (MOE) and a 30%
                  lower modulus of rupture (MOR) than
                  A. fasciculatum. Similarly, C. spinosus had a
                  significantly higher maximum vessel diameter (52.7
                  vs. 41.8 mu m) and a 92% higher theoretical k(s)
                  (and 43% higher measured k(s)) than
                  C. megacarpus. This corresponded to a 9% lower stem
                  density and 20% lower MOR than for
                  C. megacarpus. Thus, at least within these two
                  congeneric pairs of chaparral shrubs growing
                  together in the same habitat, there may be tradeoffs
                  between mechanical strength and conductive
                  efficiency of the stem xylem which correspond to
                  differences in transport physiology and life history
                  traits of sprouter versus non-sprouter species.},

                  analyzed among 32 Pinus species and representatives
                  of six other genera in Pinaceae. The total aligned
                  sequence length is 3570 bp. Of the four sequences
                  examined, matK evolved much faster than rbcL in

                  dynamics and structures of communities. In this
                  article, a two-species metapopulation model that
                  includes local competitive dynamics is analyzed to
                  study the population dynamics of two competing
                  species in spatially structured habitats. When local
                  stochastic extinction can be ignored, there are, as
                  in Lotka-Volterra equations, four outcomes of
                  interspecific competition in this model. The
                  outcomes of competition depend on the competitive
                  intensity between the competing pairs. An inferior
                  competitor and a superior competitor, or two
                  strongly competing species, can never stably
                  coexist, whereas two weak competitors (even if they
                  are very similar species) may coexist over the long
                  term in such environments. Local stochastic
                  extinction may greatly affect the outcomes of
                  interspecific competition. Two competing species can
                  or cannot stably coexist depending not only on the
                  competitive intensity between the competing pairs
                  but also on their precompetitive distributions. Two
                  weak competitors that have similar precompetitive
                  distributions can always regionally coexist. Two
                  strongly competing species that competitively
                  exclude each other in more stable habitats may be
                  able to stably coexist in highly heterogenous
                  environments if they have similar precompetitive
                  distributions. There is also a chance for an
                  inferior competitor to coexist regionally or even to
                  exclude a superior competitor when the superior
                  competitor has a narrow precompetitive distribution
                  and the inferior competitor has a wide
                  precompetitive distribution.},

                  conservatism in ecological character and highlight
                  the challenges of using phylogenies of partial
                  lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to
                  three emergent properties of communities: species

                  species in most communities, where many individuals
                  belong to a few very abundant species. Various
                  hypotheses mechanistically link a species' community
                  abundance with the diversity of the higher level
                  taxon (genus, family, order) to which it belongs,
                  but empirical data are equivocal about general
                  trends in the relation between rank-taxon diversity
                  and mean abundance. One reason for this inconclusive
                  result may be the effect of the semisubjective
                  nature of rank-based classification. We assessed the
                  relationship between clade diversity and mean
                  species abundance for two diverse tropical tree
                  communities, using both traditional rank-based
                  analysis and two new phylogenetic analyses (based on
                  the ratio of individuals to taxa at each node in the
                  phylogeny). Both rank-based and phylogenetic
                  analyses using taxonomic ranks above the species
                  level as terminal taxa detected a trend associating
                  common species with species-rich families. In
                  contrast, phylogenetic analyses using species as
                  terminal taxa could not distinguish the observed
                  distribution of species abundances from a random
                  distribution with respect to clade diversity. The
                  difference between these results might be due to (1)
                  the absence of a real phylogeny-wide relationship
                  between clade abundance and diversity, (2) the
                  influence of poor phylogenetic resolution within
                  families in our phylogenies, or (3) insufficient
                  sensitivity of our metrics to subtle tree-wide
                  effects. Further development and application of
                  phylogeny-based methods for testing
                  abundance-diversity relationships is needed.},

                  contemporary ecological processes that structure
                  community composition. I describe two indices that
                  use the number of nodes that separate taxa on a
                  phylogeny as a measure of their phylogenetic
                  relatedness. As an example of the use of these
                  indices in community analysis, I compared the mean
                  observed net relatedness of trees (greater than or
                  equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of
                  28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest
                  with the net relatedness expected if species were
                  drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324
                  species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I
                  assembled from published sources. I found that the
                  species in plots were more phylogenetically related
                  than expected by chance, a result that was
                  insensitive to various modifications to the basic
                  methodology. I tentatively infer that variation in
                  habitat among plots causes ecologically more similar
                  species to co-occur within plots. Finally, I suggest
                  a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness

                  assign probabilities to various events in the
                  dependent character given one or the other state of
                  the independent character. The CCT gives different
                  results for symmetric and asymmetric cladograms. In
                  the latter case, the proportion of branches

                  scheme},
  journal =      {Plant And Soil},
  year =         {1998},

  abstract =     {A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy
                  scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf
                  area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass
                  allocated), height of the plant's canopy at
                  maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be
                  log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be
                  described by its position in the volume formed by
                  the three axes. The advantages of the LHS scheme can
                  be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme,
                  which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and
                  Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR
                  triangle is widely cited as expressing important
                  strategic variation between species. The C-S axis
                  reflects variation in responsiveness to
                  opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme,
                  SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis
                  reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme,
                  height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of
                  coping with disturbance. A plant ecology strategy
                  scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be
                  readily positioned within the scheme could bring
                  substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of
                  experimental results, for placing detailed
                  ecophysiology in context, and for coping with
                  questions posed by global change. In the CSR
                  triangle the axes are defined by reference to
                  concepts, there is no simple protocol for
                  positioning species beyond the reference datasets
                  within the scheme, and consequently benefits of
                  worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does
                  permit any vascular land plant species to be
                  positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming
                  measurement of metabolic rates or of field
                  performance relative to other species. The merits of
                  the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this
                  potential for worldwide comparison, more than in
                  superior explanatory power within any particular
                  vegetation region. The LHS scheme avoids also two
                  other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does
                  not prejudge that there are no viable strategies
                  under high stress and high disturbance (the missing
                  quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis
                  rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct
                  aspects of the response to disturbance, height at
                  maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted
                  between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed
                  output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the
                  capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a
                  distance. The advantage of LHS axes defined through
                  a single readily-measured variable needs to be
                  weighed against the disadvantage that single plant
                  traits may not capture as much strategy variation as
                  CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the
                  benefits of potential worldwide comparison do
                  actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of
                  meaningful variation between species that is
                  captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to
                  quantifying what proportion of variation in any
                  other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with
                  the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to
                  move forward from unprofitable debates of the past
                  30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized
                  patterns that were not accommodated within the
                  scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized
                  patterns that the scheme did account for. },

                  plant community. This study sought to quantify
                  intraspecific variation in bradyspory among nine
                  populations of Banksia serrata (Proteaceae) on the
                  south coast of New South Wales. Marked differences
                  were found between populations, ranging from more
                  than 30\% of follicles open at two coastal sites, to
                  less than 5\% of follicles open at two inland heath
                  sites. Low levels of bradyspory occurred
                  particularly in coastal sites which also had Banksia
                  integrifolia, a non-bradysporous species,
                  present. In addition to spontaneous follicle opening
                  without fire, fall of infructescences to the ground
                  after breaking of branches was observed to be a
                  major contributor to seed release. At three sites
                  where fire had not occurred for many years, the
                  amount of seedling establishment since the last fire
                  corresponded well with levels of bradyspory; there
                  were no inter-fire recruits at the site with the
                  strongest bradyspory, while at the site with the
                  weakest bradyspory there were numerous inter-fire
                  plants, some with lignotubers large enough to be
                  able to tolerate the next fire. It is argued that
                  populations of B. serrata exhibit variable patterns
                  of recruitment, depending on the site
                  characteristics, ranging from complete dependence on
                  fire for population maintenance to bet-hedging
                  (spreading potential recruitment between fire events
                  and inter-fire periods). Variations in populations
                  and reproductive characteristics among sites make
                  the application of demographic models to management
                  decisions habitat-specific. },

                  summer drought. By the time of the first summer
                  after a wildfire the root systems of seedlings are
                  generally not developed enough to tap deep moisture
                  resources, so seedlings often surpass their limits
                  of tolerance to water stress, and mortality is
                  high. Selective pressures therefore are possibly
                  greater during the first summer drought after
                  wildfire than at any other stage. Seedlings of
                  Adenostoma fasciculatum Hook. & Arn. (chamise), one
                  of the most common types of chaparral shrubs in
                  southern California, which established after a
                  wildfire in November 1993, had water potentials as
                  low as -10 MPa at the end of summer 1994. Such low
                  water potentials in woody plants are known to cause
                  air emboli formation in xylem vessels and tracheids,
                  potentially blocking water transport. By contrast,
                  water potentials of the resprouts of chamise did not
                  fall below -4.5 MPa. A comparative study of chamise
                  seedlings and resprouts was initiated to ascertain
                  whether the degree of xylem embolism was correlated
                  with observed differences in minimum water potential
                  and differential mortality (seedlings 79%, resprouts
                  < 1%) of these two life stages. A newly developed
                  technique was used that allows measurement of
                  individuals with low levels of hydraulic
                  conductance. Embolism (calculated as percentage loss
                  in hydraulic conductance due to air emboli) was
                  measured on whole shoots of seedlings and
                  similar-sized branchlets of resprouts collected-at a
                  field site in the Santa Monica Mountains. Seedlings
                  with extremely low water potentials (-9.8 +/- 1.7
                  MPa, s.e., n = 10) were highly embolised (EMBOLISM =
                  82.8 +/- 2.0%). Resprouts, with an average water,
                  potential of -3.8 +/- 1.8 MPa, exhibited quite
                  moderate levels of embolism (26.0 +/- 4.6%). These
                  values suggest that xylem embolism may have
                  contributed to the high seedling mortality
                  rate. Seedlings known to have very low water
                  potentials showed a significant decrease in levels
                  of embolism (63.2 +/- 6.1%, s.e., n = 4) after a
                  rainfall event of 31 mm. Investigations suggested
                  that this was due to positive-stem pressures in
                  seedlings during or soon after the rainfall event
                  causing refilling. The timing of post-fire rainfall
                  events may be a critical factor in the survival and
                  establishment of chamise seedlings.},

  abstract =     {Modern ecology often emphasizes the distinction
                  between traditional theories of stable,
                  environmentally structured communities and a new
                  paradigm of disturbance-driven, nonequilibrium
                  dynamics. However, multiple hypotheses for observed
                  vegetation patterns have seldom been explicitly
                  tested. We used multivariate statistics and
                  variation partitioning methods to assess the
                  relative influences of environmental factors and
                  disturbance history on riparian and hillslope
                  Forests. Our study area was the Cummins Creek
                  Wilderness, located in the Oregon Coast Range. Most
                  of the wilderness burned at least once between the
                  mid-19th and early 20th centuries, creating a mosaic
                  of younger forests with a few old-growth
                  parches. Species composition on hillslopes varied
                  primarily along a climatic gradient from moist
                  maritime environments to drier inland climates but
                  was relatively insensitive to forest age
                  structure. The abundance of Tsuga heterophylla. a
                  fire-sensitive, late-successional tree species,
                  decreased with distance from old-growth patches,
                  suggesting possible seed-source limitations
                  following the historical fires. In contrast to
                  species composition, hillslope forest structure was
                  primarily related to fire history but was largely
                  independent of environmental gradients. Old-growth
                  structure characteristics such as large dominant
                  trees, large snags, high down-wood volumes. and high
                  tree size diversity increased with stand age and
                  with the presence of remnant trees that survived the
                  fires. Riparian forests had high shrub cover,
                  abundant hardwoods, and high down-wood volumes,
                  while the conifer-dominated hillslopes had high
                  overstory density and basal area. Maritime climates
                  and their associated plant species extended further
                  inland in riparian areas than on hillslopes. Advance
                  regeneration densities were higher in riparian
                  forests within 5 km of the coast than in any other
                  portion of the study area. Riparian forest structure
                  and composition were related to both environmental
                  and disturbance variables, with stream gradient and
                  size integrating much of the fine-scale variability
                  in disturbance regimes. No single theoretical
                  framework was sufficient to explain the vegetation
                  patterns observed in these forested watersheds. Our
                  findings suggest a conceptual model of forest
                  landscapes in which the relative influences of
                  environment and disturbance on vegetation patterns
                  are contingent on the facet of vegetation considered
                  (composition vs, structure) and the portion of the
                  landscape examined (hillslope vs. riparian).},

                  Vaccinium/mosses (n = 4) as ground cover, along,
                  four chronosequences. The stands of the ''lichen''
                  site type (LT) were stratified into three
                  chronosequences according to stand density and fire
                  history. Allometric equations were established from
                  90 sample trees for stem, coarse branch, fine
                  branch, twig and needle biomass. The LT stands
                  exhibited a low but sustained biomass accumulation
                  until a stand age of 383 years. AGE reached only
                  6-10 kg(dw) m(-2) after 200 years depending on stand
                  density and fire history compared to 20 kg(dw) m(-2)
                  in the ''Vaccinium'' type (VT) stands. Leaf area
                  index (LAI) in the LT stands remained at 0.5-1.5 and
                  crown cover was 30-60%, whereas LAI reached 2.5 and
                  crown cover was > 100% in the VT stands. Although
                  nearest-neighbour analyses suggested the existence
                  of density-dependent mortality, fire impact turned
                  out to have a much stronger effect on density
                  dynamics. Fire scar dating and calculation of mean
                  and initial fire return intervals revealed that
                  within the LT stands differences in structure and
                  biomass were related to the severity of fire
                  regimes, which in turn was related to the degree of
                  landscape fragmentation by wetlands. Self-thinning
                  analysis was used to define the local carrying
                  capacity for biomass. A series of undisturbed LT
                  stands was used to characterise the upper
                  self-thinning boundary. Stands that had experienced
                  a moderate fire regime were positioned well below
                  the self-thinning boundary in a distinct
                  fire-thinning band of reduced major axis regression
                  slope -0.26. We discuss how this downward shift
                  resulted from alternating phases of density
                  reduction by fire and subsequent regrowth. We
                  conclude that biomass in Siberian Scots pine forests
                  is strongly influenced by fire and that climate
                  change will affect ecosystem functions predominantly
                  via changes in fire regimes.},

                  (Asteraceae) was studied at 6 sites, with a
                  chronosequence of ages from <1 to greater than or
                  equal to 15 years, at St Lucia, South
                  Africa. C. odorata density, biomass, seed production
                  and soil seed banks were quantified in three
                  microsites: sun, semi-shade and shade. C. odorata
                  density decreased with invasion age, apparently as a
                  self-thinning process. Biomass per unit area and
                  seed production/plant increased over the first 10
                  years, but declined greatly at greater than or equal
                  to 15 years. C. odorata plants grew larger and had
                  much greater seed production in the sun relative to
                  semi-shade, with small plants producing few if any
                  seeds in the shade. Seed production in the sun
                  varied from 2000 (<1-year old site) to 260 000 (10
                  year) seeds m(-2) annum(-1). About 20-46% of seeds
                  produced were germinable and showed the same trend
                  with age of invasion, but was particularly low after
                  greater than or equal to 15 years. Assessment of
                  soil seed banks immediately prior to seed production
                  (seed greater than or equal to 10 months old),
                  indicates that about 5-10% of seeds in the sun and
                  11-22% in the shade were still germinable, resulting
                  in germinable seed densities of 12-385 and 158-511
                  m(-2), respectively (excluding the greater than or
                  equal to 15-year old site). A greenhouse trial
                  showed that burial of seeds, relative to those at
                  the surface, and provision of less water,
                  significantly improved seed persistence in the soil,
                  while light intensity had no effect. Control of
                  C. odorata is difficult due to rapid attainment of
                  reproductive maturity, large production of
                  wind-dispersed seeds and a short-term persistent
                  seed bank. An integrated control strategy either
                  excluding fire (coastal forest sites) or using fire
                  prior to seed release in July/August to kill plants
                  and soil-stored seeds immediately prior to seed
                  production, together with biological, chemical

  abstract =     {A cost-benefit approach was developed to analyze the
                  carbon budget of the lowest Scots pine (Pinus
                  sylvestris L.) branches subject to abscission. In
                  addition to within-branch growth and respiratory
                  costs, the budget included an estimation of a
                  branch's share of the maintenance respiration of the
                  stem and root. A branch was considered productive if
                  the budget was positive. Foliar gas exchange and
                  woody-tissue respiration were nondestructively
                  measured at monthly intervals during the growing
                  season on the six lowest branches of 10-year-old
                  Scots pine trees, to the moment when the branches
                  died naturally. Photosynthetic light response and
                  temperature response of respiration, together with
                  measurements of canopy light conditions and
                  meteorological data, were used to calculate seasonal
                  carbon budgets for the branches. Maintenance
                  respiration of stems and roots was estimated from
                  published data. All but one of the branches studied
                  were found to be nonproductive over the growing
                  season. Following a decrease in photosynthetic
                  capacity in July, the cumulative budget became
                  negative and the branches died, indicating that a
                  negative carbon budget corresponds with the onset of
                  abscission of the lowest branches.},

                  finite number of individuals with related
                  sequences. Such a population will not behave in the
                  deterministic way expected for an infinite

                  models, where the whole of the population is

                  landscape with a single fitness peak. This landscape
                  is simple enough for finite size population effects
                  to be studied in detail. Each of the N individuals
                  in the population is represented by a sequence of L
                  genes which may either be advantageous or
                  disadvantageous. The fitness of an individual with k
                  disadvantageous genes is w(k) = (1 - s)(k), where s
                  determines the strength of selection. In the limit L
                  tends to infinity the model reduces to the problem
                  of Muller's Ratchet: the population moves away from
                  the fitness peak at a constant rate due to the
                  accumulation of disadvantageous mutations. For
                  finite length sequences, a population placed
                  initially at the fitness peak will evolve away from
                  the peak until a balance is reached between mutation
                  and selection. From then on the population will
                  wander through a spherical shell in sequence space
                  at a constant mean Hamming distance < k > from the
                  optimum sequence. This has been likened to the idea
                  of a cloud layer hanging below the mountain peak. We
                  give an approximate theory for the way < k > depends
                  on N, L, s, and the mutation rate u. This is found

                  genes is W(K) = (1 - s)(k), where s determines the
                  strength of, selection. In the limit L --> infinity,
                  the model reduces to the problem of Muller's
                  Ratchet: the population moves away from the fitness
                  peak at a constant rate due to the accumulation of
                  disadvantageous mutations. For finite length
                  sequences, a population placed initially at the

                  balance is reached between mutation and
                  selection. From then on the population will wander
                  through a spherical shell in sequence space at a
                  constant mean Hamming distance [(k) over bar] from
                  the optimum sequence. We give an approximate theory
                  for the way [(k) over bar] depends on N, L, s, and
                  the mutation rate u. This is found to agree well
                  with numerical simulation. Selection is less
                  effective on small populations, so [(k) over bar]
                  increases as N decreases. Our simulations also show
                  that the mean overlap between gene sequences
                  separated by a time of t generations is of the form
                  Q(t) = Q(infinity) + (Q(0) - Q(infinity))exp(-2ut),
                  which means that the rate of evolution within the
                  spherical shell is independent of the selection
                  strength. We give a simplified model which can be
                  solved exactly for which Q(t) has precisely this
                  form. We then consider the limit L --> infinity
                  keeping U = uL constant. We suppose that each
                  mutation may be favourable with probability p, or
                  unfavourable with probability 1 - p. We show that
                  for p less than a critical value p(c), the
                  population decreases in fitness for all values of U,
                  whereas for p(c) < p < 1/2, the population increases
                  in fitness for small U and decreases in fitness for
                  large U. In this case there is an optimum non-zero
                  value of U at which the fitness increases most
                  rapidly, and natural selection will favour species
                  with non-zero mutation rates. (C) 1996 Academic

  abstract =     {In this paper we review those aspects that are
                  relevant to the development of a mechanistic
                  ecological theory to account for the structure and
                  dynamics of Mediterranean forests, focusing our
                  attention on mixed forests of helm oak (Quercus ilex
                  L.), a shade-tolerant, slow-growing species that
                  resprouts vigorously after disturbance, and Aleppo
                  pine (Pinus halepen sis M.), a fast-growing,
                  nonresprouting, shade-intolerant species. The main
                  objectives of this report are: to introduce some of
                  the primary features of these forests, showing their
                  structural complexity and historical peculiarities;
                  to show that much of this complexity can be
                  conceptually reduced to two main factors of
                  variation, soil-moisture gradients and a complex
                  interaction of historical management and disturbance
                  regimes; and to contrast the unique features of
                  Mediterranean systems with other communities that
                  have inspired generalization in ecology. Plants in
                  Mediterranean-climate regions must face several
                  environmental constraints during their life cycle:
                  water limitation, competition for light, and a
                  complex set of disturbance regimes, mainly fire,
                  herbivory, and human exploitation. The response of
                  co-occurring species to a given set of environmental
                  constraints depends on a combination of
                  physiological and morphological traits. In helm
                  oak-Aleppo pine forests, the lower limit of
                  distribution along a soil-moisture gradient appears
                  to be controlled by dry-season water stress on
                  seedling performance, and the upper limit seems to
                  be controlled by shade tolerance relative to
                  competitors. The processes that generate and
                  maintain these patterns are related to the responses
                  of the two species to the water and light
                  environments that result from interacting gradients
                  of disturbance and resource availability. The
                  dynamics of mixed helm oak-Aleppo pine forests may
                  be represented along two major environmental axes:
                  water availability and light intensity; namely, time
                  since last disturbance. At the regional scale, the
                  presence of holm oak and Aleppo pine is expected to
                  be driven mainly by the precipitation regime, with
                  the proportion of Aleppo pine increasing toward the
                  driest border and with helm oak being the dominant
                  species in areas with higher precipitation. Changes
                  of dominance of helm oak and Aleppo pine also
                  respond to water availability at the local scale. In
                  this case, variations between species depend on
                  different factors in a complex way, because reduced
                  soil-moisture levels may result either from low
                  precipitation or from topography and edaphic
                  features. The dynamics of helm oak-Aleppo pine
                  forests are also determined by temporal changes in
                  canopy closure; that is, forest recovery after
                  disturbance. In this case, the proportion of Aleppo
                  pine would increase in recently disturbed stands
                  (i.e., with high light intensity reaching the forest
                  floor), whereas regeneration of helm oak would be
                  dominant under partially closed canopies. Theories
                  of forest dynamics developed in humid regions may
                  apply only poorly to Mediterranean plant
                  communities, where vegetation change is
                  qualitatively or quantitatively different. Thus,
                  succession in temperate forests appears to be driven
                  by differences in light availability and shade
                  tolerance; but in Mediterranean plant communities,
                  water limitation is of greater importance for the
                  distribution of forest species. In Mediterranean
                  landscapes the interaction of life-history
                  strategies with changing environments is difficult
                  to infer from observational and experimental
                  studies. A mechanistic approach, in which
                  competition or plant performance is measured as a
                  function of resource availability, seems more
                  feasible. The idea should be to develop multispecies
                  models calibrated specifically for Mediterranean
                  forests in a combined program of modeling, field
                  research, and experimentation.},

                  how S. invicta affects complex mutualistic
                  relationships. In some eastern forests of North
                  America, 30% of herbaceous species have
                  ant-dispersed seeds. We conducted experiments to
                  determine if fire ants are attracted to seeds of
                  these plant species and assessed the amount of
                  scarification or damage that results from handling
                  by fire ants. Fire ants removed nearly 100% of seeds

                  {V. rotundifolia} seeds. Our study is the first to
                  document that red imported fire ants are attracted
                  to and remove seeds of species adapted for ant
                  dispersal. Moreover, fire ants might damage these
                  seeds and discard them in sites unfavorable for
                  germination and seedling establishment. (C) 2001

                  coniferous forest reproduction in the Sierra Nevada,
                  California, we monitored reproduction for 5 years in
                  47 plots arrayed across a steep elevational
                  (climatic) gradient. We found that both absolute
                  seedling densities (stems < 1.37 m) and seedling
                  densities relative to overstory parent tree basal
                  area declined sharply with elevation. Rates of
                  seedling turnover (the average of birth and death
                  rates) also declined with elevation. In contrast,
                  seed production was not predicted by elevation and
                  was highly variable from year to year. During a mast
                  year of seed production, the intensity of masting
                  was uneven among plots. Seedling densities were
                  elevated only during the single year immediately
                  following the mast year, suggesting reproduction in
                  our forests may be primarily limited by abiotic
                  factors such as the availability of suitable sites
                  and weather. Disturbance also clearly affected
                  reproduction; plots that had recently burned had
                  significantly higher seedling to parent tree ratios
                  for Abies species, suggesting that even though
                  established Abies concolor may be relatively
                  susceptible to fire, the species can recover rapidly
                  through prolific reproduction. Since reproductive
                  failures may be our earliest signal of changing
                  forest conditions, seedling dynamics could provide a
                  sensitive, if variable, indicator of environmental
                  changes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  abstract =     {We have tested the hypothesis that reseeding is a
                  plesiomorphic character state and that sprouting is
                  a derived state in Aspalathus linearis, and that the
                  latter is an adaptation to ensure fire-survival in a
                  fireprone environment. Samples of five seeder and
                  four sprouter populations of A. linearis were
                  examined by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis to
                  assess the amount of genetic differentiation within
                  and between sprouting and seeding populations, and
                  to determine the extent of gene flow between the
                  populations. Leaf extracts were surveyed for ten
                  enzymes and gene products revealed genetic variation
                  at 13 (76%) of 17 protein coding loci. Allele
                  frequency differences were found between sprouting
                  and seeding populations and genetic distance values
                  show that the sprouters are grouped separate from
                  the seeders, thus providing support for the
                  morphological data on which the above mentioned
                  hypothesis is based. It is evident that evolution
                  operates at the population level in A. linearis.},

                  the establishment of reserves and the management
                  offlagship, umbrella, indicator, and keystone
                  species) are valuable, they entail practical and
                  conceptual difficulties. A focus on niche
                  construction and ecosystem engineering, however,
                  could provide new insights and methods for
                  conservation biology. Many organisms modulate the
                  availability of resources to other species by
                  causing state changes in biotic or abiotic materials
                  (ecosystem engineering), in the process frequently
                  changing the selection to which the ecosystem
                  engineers and other organisms are exposed (niche
                  construction). We describe growing evidence that
                  organisms have significant nontrophic impacts on
                  ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity, and
                  outline established means of identifying key species
                  involved in niche construction. On the basis of this
                  engineering perspective, wepropose a number of
                  measures that could be employed to enhance
                  conservation efforts.},
