  abstract = {An analysis of the Functional Imaging Analysis Contest (FIAC) data
	is presented using spatial wavelet processing. This technique allows
	the image to be filtered adaptively according to the data itself,
	rather than relying on a predetermined filter. This adaptive filtering
	leads to better estimation of the parameters and contrasts in terms
	of mean squared error. It will be shown that by introducing a slight
	bias into the estimation, a large reduction in the variance can be
	achieved, leading to better overall mean squared error estimates.
	As no single filter needs to be preselected, results containing many
	scales of information can be found. In the FIAC data, it is shown
	that both small-scale and large-scale (smoother, more dispersed)
	effects occur. The combination of small- and large-scale effects
	detected in the FIAC data would be easy to miss using conventional
	single filter analysis.},

  title = {Prefrontal cortical function and anxiety: controlling attention to

  journal = {Nat Neurosci},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {184--188},
  number = {2},

  abstract = {Threat-related stimuli are strong competitors for attention, particularly
	in anxious individuals. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI) with healthy human volunteers to study how the processing
	of threat-related distractors is controlled and whether this alters
	as anxiety levels increase. Our work builds upon prior analyses of
	the cognitive control functions of lateral prefrontal cortex (lateral
	PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We found that rostral ACC
	was strongly activated by infrequent threat-related distractors,
	consistent with a role for this area in responding to unexpected
	processing conflict caused by salient emotional stimuli. Participants
	with higher anxiety levels showed both less rostral ACC activity
	overall and reduced recruitment of lateral PFC as expectancy of threat-related
	distractors was established. This supports the proposal that anxiety
	is associated with reduced top-down control over threat-related distractors.
	Our results suggest distinct roles for rostral ACC and lateral PFC
	in governing the processing of task-irrelevant, threat-related stimuli,
	and indicate reduced recruitment of this circuitry in anxiety.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the literature on intellectual change during and
	following pregnancy in humans. Whilst much has been written in an
	impressionistic way, this area has received little serious scientific
	attention, and at the beginning of the twenty first century considerable
	gaps in our knowledge remain. Targets for future research are suggested.
	The second part of the paper reviews the complex hormonal changes
	that place during pregnancy and birth and examines the impact that
	these changes may have on cognition, drawing together the findings
	from a number of scientific fields. Whilst this review may generate
	more questions than it answers, we hope that it will create interest
	and stimulate research in this long neglected field.},
